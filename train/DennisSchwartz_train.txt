{} the title comes from the markings found on packages delivered by the postal service <0>
the inspiration of the film comes from the studiolike hollywood musicals of the s <0>
according to rivette he was most influenced by stanley donens musical give a girl a break <0>
his other influences are the great french directors of the past such as renoir and vigo <0>
i rented up down fragile along with rivettes first feature paris belongs to us and it was interesting to see how rivette kept some of the same themes how one has the need to be alone and also the need to be with a group how one handles reality and fantasy and the politics of being <0>
it is his firm belief that the individual alone is responsible for his lifes direction it is ones responsibility to take charge of ones life not anyone else <0>
in his newer film which was stylistically and cinematically a much more sophisticated and welldone production than the former we see these themes come out clearer brought out by a director who is more assured of his abilities to work with actors on a more experimental basis as they each collaborate on the script as he gets them to improvise in their roles <1>
{} the film follows the life of its three main characters ninon natashe louise marianne and ida laurence as they try to work out their many problems in life occasionally breaking out in song and dance at the oddest moments even when the film is moving along in a dramatic fashion <0>
this lighthearted approach to the film annoyed me on my first viewing but when i watched the film for a second time i felt more relaxed and was able to get in the mood rivette probably intended for his film to be viewed which is that it is up to me to fill in the meaning of the story <1>
but this also allowed me not to take this film as a very serious work but more or less as a spectacle in the hollywood tradition a tradition that rivette gladly acknowledges a kinship and admiration for <-1>
{} its entertainment value was enhanced by the gorgeous use of colors which captured the summertime paris streets and parks as well as the beautful indoor sets <1>
we followed the moped messenger exwhore ninon do her deliveries <0>
then we viewed louises splendidly delicious living quarters she is from an upperclass family having just been released from a clinic after being fiveyears in a coma following an accident <0>
she is being followed for her own protection by an neophyte bodyguard lucien bruno hired by her father without her knowledge to protect her <0>
she will awkwardly meet and fall in love with him <0>
ida is the adopted orphan working as a librarian looking for her real parents wanting to find out why they put her up for adoption still plagued by that <0>
roland andre is the set designer the male thread that connects all three women heroines the gene kelly lookalike <0>
he meets louise in her aunts house the one she has just inherited he falls in love with ninon at the site of their respective workplaces which are on the same street where she works as a messenger and he designs stage sets and lastly he meets ida while doing research in the library she works at hearing her hum a tune that he recognizes which turns out to be a song sarah anna uses in her nightclub act a place he often frequents <0>
sarah is the real mother ida has been looking for <0>
{} that this musical is better than most of the hollywood musicals it flatteringly immitates is true to a certain extent <1>
it is better in the sense that rivette is able to bring out the poetry of the reallife situations and present his existential view of life and not just play for the song and dance to be the thing though the hollywood performers are more professional and have better voices and quicker feet is certainly true but they also seem to rely on an artificial story <-1>
while for rivette as amateur as his performers might seem to be in comparison the story still seems real and important and the musical numbers are intrusive but seem to be imbued with a magical quality about them that makes them seem just as fantasy oriented as the typical hollywood production and in my opinion that makes for a more interesting and better film <1>
though it makes for a different way for american audiences to appreciate the musical a form of film that hollywood at one time was the most innovative creators of but has now all but abandoned that genre because of high production costs and not enough box office gross to show for its efforts <-1>

{} bringing out the dead in one sense is a lovehate black comedy about the relationship the director martin scorsese has with his home turf of nyc in the early s and in the other sense it is a psychological study about those who are trying to save the sick in a dying city when they cant be sure if they can even save themselves <0>
frank pierce cage is a burnt out paramedic who has gone on one too many missions of mercy thinking that he needs just one last save to regain his equilibrium <0>
he now sees the ghosts of those he couldnt save everywhere he looks <0>
the conflict inside him revolves around the tremendous high he gets over saving a life there is no better feeling he tells us in a voiceover his usual way of conveying to the viewer what he is thinking and the low point is from all the depravity and hopelessness and horror he sees all around him everyday <0>
{} his ambulance route is in the neighborhood of his birth hells kitchen though his family moved upstate when he was of high school age as so many others have previously done to remove themselves from the besetment of drugs and despair and crime that has taken over the streets in that once mostly irish enclave <0>
{} his ambulance buzzes past the unnatural everyday sights of the city of hookers working the streets one of them who is pregnant children drug dealers the homeless smelly drunks and a frightening look at how the havenots live in a city of morbid neon lights and graffiti hiriser buildings <0>
these images become a reminder of what hell might look like <0>
{} there is the ghost of one patient that frank lost recently a young homeless woman named rose that he keeps seeing over and over again causing him to be severely depressed to suffer from insomnia to not eat properly and to hit the bottle <0>
that he is stressed out should come as no surprise his job might very well be the most stressful one in the city <0>
so who could blame him if he reports late to work and uses up all his sick days and cant get fired even though he wants to all because the city needs his body out there and his downfall is not that uncommon for a job like his anyway <0>
{} scorsese emphasizes how tormenting this job is by following the ambulance driver around for three painful night shifts through the glittering lights of manhattan each night frank is with a different partner and with each there is a different outlook on the job exhibited <0>
that in a nutshell is the plot of the film as this is a story mostly about character development and the unique personalities of those who choose to work under such trying conditions and of the uncertain relationship that develops between two kindred spirits mary and frank <0>
the audience is taken along for the grim ride and the entertainment comes from the constant gallows humor of these very obsessively comedic ems men who provide the necessary breaks in the story for everyone concerned that is audience and driver alike <1>
things are so insane that if you dont laugh you can succumb to the intensity of the situation by just watching it <0>
how insane the situation is is highlighted from the first radio dispatch heard in the background where the call is to help a woman in distress because a roach crawled in her ear <0>
this is a dark comedy in the real sense of being dark with the noir style to the film provided by scorseses frequent screenwriter paul schrader taxi driverraging bullthe last temptation of christ <0>
{} the hospital that is on his route a place of bedlam and futility is named our lady of perpetual mercy but called by the ems personnel misery and for good reason <0>
this is a place where there arent enough beds to handle all the victims from gunshots and heart attacks and bad drug trips <0>
the doctors work relentlessly on double shifts and the atmosphere is frighteningly horrific with wild screams patients tied to their beds so that they wouldnt go on a rampage and utter chaos in the lobby where security guards menacingly try to keep order <0>
{} the first call that frank goes out on is with larry goodman his chatty and obese partner enamored by fastfood places and concerned about not eating the same meal twice in one week who is planning to soon be in the suburbs running his own private ambulance service <0>
{} they respond to a heart attack victim in a walkup tenement building where the victim has been dead for a few minutes and the family is bewilderedly huddled around their patriarch hoping for a miracle <0>
frank who is considered to be the best at saving lives has been working as a paramedic for the past five years <0>
this could be the rescue he needs as he desperately tries to save the old mans life by giving him cpr and shocks to the heart in order to bring back his patient from the dead <0>
as a last resort he puts on a sinatra album the old man liked <0>
this seems to give the patient a pulse and the family some hope <0>
the patients anxious daughter the former junkie mary burke patricia arquette who is the actual wife of cage forms a bond of friendship instantly with frank who will act as a liaison for her to pass on information about her father from the hospital <0>
they will meet together for the next three nights in the chaos of the hospital where her father is just one of many emergencies handled during the nights graveyard shift and their ambiguous relationship will center around the reports frank gives her on the condition of her father <0>
{} frank feels marys pain and wants her love or approval he desperately is in need of a woman to comfort him just like she needs his moral support he looks like a priest to her <0>
we know very little about franks personal life except what little he tells us in the voiceover about his divorce but he doesnt tell us why his wife left him nor do we see where he lives or who his friends are or what his interests are other than the job which seems to be his whole life <0>
the few times we see him out of uniform in civilian clothes he looks ordinary <0>
in uniform he looks like a god <0>
{} his second partner is the hilarious loudmouth marcus ving rhames who is a mixture of playboy gin drinking rogue and jesus fanatic with a devastating sense of humor <0>
marcus hope is that god will see to it that he gets through the night <0>
their night out results in them treating a drug overdosed punk rocker who took a deadly new drug on the scene called red poison and of marcus speeding recklessly to another call which results in the ambulance overturning leaving them both with minor injuries and lots of nervous laughter over their narrow escape from death <0>
{} the partners seem to be getting more intense with each night shift as the third driver tom sizemore points out that the full moon is out and it is saturday as he gleefully rubs his hands together expecting plenty of action <0>
tom is the forceful type he likes to take matters into his own hands <0>
on his shift the two most memorable things that happen are a drug shootout in an apartment building where one victim is dying from gunshot wounds and the other is impaled on the terrace gate cliff curtis as he jumped from the th floor to the th to escape his fate <0>
as a coincidence he gave frank some kind of a stress relieving pill the previous night which frank took in a moment of weakness and desperation as he followed mary to this drug pad concerned that she couldnt handle the strain any longer of learning about her fathers death especially when she wasnt able to put a closure on their stormy relationship by having one last chance to talk to him she hasnt even seen her father for the last three years due to an argument <0>
her father is someone that frank actually saved and the hospital might have been able to keep him alive but frank thought he heard the mans voice telling him he didnt want to live anymore and so he failed to give him the necessary shocks to keep him alive <0>
the other major incident on this shift was the violent reaction of tom to the deranged noel marc anthony who is completely wasted on drugs and is known to the paramedics as a very troubled man <0>
he should have been placed in a mental institution if this was a civilized city but who now wanders the street taking a baseball bat and knocking out car windows with it <0>
toms way of handling him is to teach him a lesson with a beating while franks approach is to identify with his insanity and try to communicate as best he can with him <0>
{} it becomes apparent that frank is going bonkers while the other drivers are handling the job much better than he is they are getting by larry by dreaming of better days to come marcus by finding god and tom by taking things into his own hands <0>
it is just frank who is falling completely apart thinking he must save someone in order for him to be redeemed <0>
he is especially upset because over the last few months everyone seems to be dying on him <0>
mary now becomes his only hope <0>
he must either save her from becoming an addict again or she must save him from his ghostlike existence <0>
mary is likened in his eyes to the virgin mary as the kind of relationship that forms between the two is a difficult one to apprehend as they are both caught by their own demons and are so afraid of love and of not being loved and they are afraid that the tenderness they have for others might drain them and leave them without enough energy for them to save themselves <0>
this all leads up to the films final shot where he becomes like the son in a religious painting of christ resting after a long journey in the arms of the holy mother cuddled up next to her in the bright whiteness of a spiritual light <0>
could that be his salvation a spiritual one the only hope there is for frank <0>
{} by the time the third night shift ends the audience is strained and left overwhelmed by all the noise from the city streets the background rock music the depravity of the hospital the constant frenetic chatter of the paramedics and the need for them to have some artificial way to get by their shift <0>
franks way is through coffee whiskey vitamin shots and living with ghosts and none of them work <0>
this film is intense all right and it drags on for much too long a look at the insane world it envisions making its way through a grotesque looking city and a hospital that is likened to a crazy house <1>
{} the misery uncovered is catching like certain diseases are <0>
but is it worth it <-1>
does the film have something salient to say as scorsese seems more comfortable in these surroundings than he did in the foreign turf of the age of innocence and kundun for instance <-1>
is there entertainment value in this story <0>
that i really dont know but i do know that it all seemed too real and that the acting was superb one couldnt help but get entangled in the lives of the characters and there was a rush of adrenaline emanating from the highs and even the lows experienced <1>
the nicolas cage performance caught the nuances of his character in a bewitching manner as in his crazed ems role he catches the futility and desperation he feels gnawing at him from inside and displays an engaging chemistry with the three drivers and with patricia arquette <2>
though her performance seemed to be too coy at times and too conveniently vulnerable to be totally credible she nevertheless is the perfect counterpoint to his tortured being sharing with him all the anguish of living and leaving him with the uncertainty of how she feels about him romantically <1>
the ambulance drivers more or less drove home the philosophical points of the film as they acted out the insanity of the situation they were in and complemented his mood swings of being beaten down or hyper with the sheer madness of their gall and sometimes perversive attitude toward the job <0>
{} the photography was mesmerizing capturing the hostile living conditions of the neighborhood and filling the screen at times with the beauty of a fire show amid the sirens and turbulence of the night and in the background we can see the famous city skyscrapers of the city shimmering in the night sky seemingly changing colors <2>
{} im glad that scorsese has made a film that asks a lot of questions of the viewer questions that take time to answer because they are complex and could best be answered by ones experience with matters of life and death <2>
and from what is mentioned in the story we learn that there are spirits that pull you one way or the other and sometimes the pull is not to want to live anymore <0>
that should give one something to think about <1>
{} scorsese has made a technically perfect film and an artistic one but is one that is not suited for everyones taste since it takes getting used to the trauma of the story and its appalling inertia but the benefits are immense for those who stick with it <1>
scorsese is undoubtedly one of the finest working directors and he knows how to provoke an audience to feel the pain of someone else something that is very difficult to obtain in this medium <2>
this is a very tough film to honestly say that you thoroughly enjoyed it but whats more important than that is how it lingers with you for a long time after seeing it and how compelling it is in a meaningful way <1>
this film i expect will be better thought of than most films of the s that attempt to focus in on the city landscape including all those films that were so entertaining but in the end were not as nurturing to the soul as this one was <1>
{} it is easy to compare this film to his masterpiece taxi driver and say that both films were about a dying city about someone who works by driving either a taxi or ambulance at night and about a similar hero who had a tortured soul that needed redemption but the former film was so much better because it had more action in it more energy and did not compromise the storys pessimism <-1>
but i found this film to be more subtle and more optimistic in a spiritual sense and even its most pressing fault that the subject matter hits too close to the miserable reality of things in the city and makes this a difficult film to sit through should not be that deterring to the serious moviegoer <2>
this film cant help being anything but a disturbing film one that questions the degree of contemporary insanity and it is not necessarily a better or worse film than the other one but it is one that has more psychological layers of complexity to it that needs to be looked at more carefully <1>

{} writerdirectoracting starartist takashi kitano has broken ground from traditional films taking risks that defy explaining how to classify this very violent and tender film that sways between the two extremes and as the critic joel hoberman so astutely states fireworks is a cross between ozus late spring and don siegels dirty harry <0>
{} kitano is not noted for plot development and for understanding women <0>
his forte is in the raw nerve of his films and the stark beauty of the cinematography <0>
one should expect the unexpected from his films <0>
the violence is brutal and fastpaced <0>
for his effort he has won the grand prize at venice the first time a japanese film has done this since rashomon <0>
{} nishi kitano as a detective is part of a gangster stakeout with his partner horibe osugi and two younger detectives <0>
but horibe tells nishi to visit his hospitalized leukemiastricken wife miyuki kishimoto and dismisses the other two policemen <0>
this turns out to be a bad move and horibe is paralyzed by the gangsters <0>
the narrative is told in flashbacks so any part of nishis life could pop up on the screen and what would seem like a commonplace crime story unfolding deceptively turns out to be much more than that even as nishi gets revenge on the yakumas who did this to his friend unafraid of bringing untold graphic violence to the screen <0>
for one of the punk gangsters he sticks a pencil in his eye <0>
you better believe that caught my attention <0>
but if that was all this film was about the dirty harry description of the film would have been completely apropos <0>
{} feeling responsible for horibe and grieving for his wife the film turns into a road movie as he escorts his wife to the sights she wants to see for the last time leaving him to wonder why she would choose to see snow before dying <0>
he shows great tenderness toward his friend horibe and in his taciturn manner he is not a man who likes conversation he sends him art materials so he can somehow keep his mind occupied during the suicidal period he is going through and we see some magnificent surreal and colorful drawings as a result which are the actual drawings of kitano <0>
in between these grand gestures he violently confronts the gangsters responsible for his friends condition <0>
{} this highly original film that is at times a masterpiece and other times a grade b movie is difficult for me to penetrate what it all means as far as a commentary on japanese culture but the japanese critics have been critical of his attacks on japanese conformity while the japanese public accepts him as a popular performer and stage comedian even if his films have not been as well received in japan as they have been in foreign countries <0>
as far as i am concerned i prefer ozu i am more taken with his intellect and perspective but i can appreciate the artistic direction kitano is taking his violent subject matter to as i found this volatile film to be something special but something i cant completely comprehend because i dont really know what he is trying to say as if that really matters <1>
yet his film is a visual treat to behold and for that i am grateful and accepting of his work <1>

{} for three quarters of the film an exciting somewhat plausible thriller takes place that is even occasionally intriguing <1>
then it comes apart and turns into routine hollywood copout stuff <-1>
as a result this film wastes splendid acting jobs by clint ed and scott <-1>
{} clint is luther whitney a renowned thief who finds his way into the hidden vault of the billionaire sullivans marshall mansion and robs him of his jewels and cash <0>
but complications arise while luther hides in the vault looking out from behind a oneway mirror and mrs sullivan melora comes home inebriated and begins having some rough sex with alan richmond gene <0>
he happens to be the president of the united states <0>
things get out of hand and when the two secret service agents scott and dennis see that the president is about to get knifed to death they shoot mrs sullivan <0>
gloria russell judy the presidents chief of staff then starts the coverup rolling <0>
the result is that luther has to go on the run <0>
{} what remains entertaining is that the badgood guy luther being chased by the goodbad guy alan while the goodgood guy the chief police investigator in the homicide and robbery seth frank ed tries to unravel the mysteries of the case <0>
it is no mystery to the audience because they saw exactly what happened <0>
so what this film is all about is the amorality of the president and the absolute power he wields and the catandmouse games between the police and secret service and luther <0>
there is also some romance going on but of the blandest kind imaginable between clints estranged daughter laura whom he still cares a great deal about and seth frank <0>
{} it is watchable hokum with a hardly credible story getting by solely on solid acting jobs from the leads <1>
the script calls for no bold statements about the politics of the white house which makes the film rather weak in scope and purpose <-1>
yet the film is bearable fortunate to be in the hands of someone as deft as clint or else with a lesser director it could have certainly sunk to an abysmally lower level though one wouldnt be far wrong thinking it has already sunk to that level <-1>

{} a flirtatious window washer on a skyscraper has his head lopped off while on the job <0>
one cop asks another how did that happen <0>
i dunno maybe his head came loose <0>
a tenured college professor is found flayed in his hotel room while on a visit to nyc as the cops rule out suicide since there is no reason for a tenured teacher to kill himself <0>
a woman sunbathing in the nude on the roof of her building is attacked by a giant bird and is carried off to be flayed and dumped in the roof storage area of the chrysler building where the birds are nesting and hatching future attacking birds in giant eggs <0>
is there a connection between the flayer and the birds <0>
detectives shepherd david carradine and powell richard roundtree are assigned the case and shepherd immediately puts two and two together and comes up with this logical deduction that this must be a ritual killing <0>
so he sees the museum of natural historys curator and hears his explanations on myths of sacrifice and it now comes obvious even to a skeptic like him that this must be the q in the title of the film quetzecoatl the flying aztec god that the curator is talking about who can be prayed back into existence and kept alive with the blood that must be given willingly by the victim or else the ritual performed by the priest the flayer is meaningless and the bird or god cant gain strength from the blood <0>
{} meanwhile petty criminal exjunkie nerd and convict the quicktalking jimmy quinn michael moriarty tries out for a piano singers gig in the bar his girlfriend joan candy works at using a piece a black man who killed seven white men taught him how to play when he was doing hard time but he doesnt get the job <0>
so he takes the other job he was offered earlier on in the day to drive a getaway car in a jewelry heist <0>
quinn is a born loser so natch the job goes sour when the hoods make him come into the store with them and give him a gun even though he asserts that wasnt part of the deal <0>
when things get fouled up inside the store he walks out with the diamonds but doesnt have the keys to the car and then gets hit by a cab as the bag full of jewels disappears in the street whereas he will have to walk with a limp for the rest of the film while being pursued by the mobsters and tracked down by the police because the other hoods get caught in the store and rat him out <0>
but in hiding out from the mob he inadvertently stumbles upon where the bird nests <0>
{} this is real funny stuff <2>
the special effects for this lowbudget film are surprising welldone <2>
and things are happening so fast that there is no time to think about what is happening since logic has already been swooped away by that fuckin bird as that is how it is referred to by nycs finest as they scratch their heads over this one gathering witness reports of blood dripping on them from skyscrapers and a huge bird that is seen in the sky carrying off construction workers and on a luxury building a rooftop swimmer is swooped away by a huge bird in front of everyone else in the pool <0>
{} quinn while running from the two hoods who want the jewels leads them right into the claws of the nesting bird giggling at their misfortune of being eating to death and realizing he has his meal ticket if he plays his cards right as the police question him about the jewelry heist but are really concerned about all those mysterious killings <0>
{} what is amazing is how well the story and the routine investigation of the cops into this bizarre newspaper headline story go together <1>
as carradine takes it all in as just another day at the office while quinn couldnt be more goofier and likable smiling like he won the lottery when he blackmails the city into giving him a million bucks for his info stating that he also wants a nixonlike pardon <0>
{} powell as the straight gung ho cop has the honor of teaming up with an undercover cop disguised as a mime as they chase the lunatic priest over nyc rooftops after the priest fails to get the nottooswift quinn to pray with him so he can voluntarily give his blood to god <0>
{} i loved the explanation given for what god is an invisible force we fear and in our vanity we try to make it human <1>
{} sometimes the lowbudget nonsense films that dont take themselves that serious and just go out there and do their funny thing are much better than those serious films that win all those critical praises from the illustrious establishment critics and this is one of those films in the genre of someone like an edgar ulmer <1>
all you have to remember about this film is that what you have seen is all that there is to see there are no hidden messages or deep symbolic meanings for you to ponder <0>

it was the summer of the vietnam war protests neil armstrongs walk on the moon and woodstock so the music in the background is appropriately enough from joni mitchell carole king grateful dead richie havens dylan and hendrix and so on which should bring on a case of nostalgia for those who were around during that period <1>

she now feels that she cant communicate her feelings to her husband that life has past her by <0>

tempted by what seems to be the greener grass on the other side of the fence pearl has an affair with the gentle and laidback hippie on the night of the walk on the moon and is seen by her daughter with him while attending the nearby woodstock concert <0>
the film purposefully means to mirror the couples life with the changes that altered the face of the nation during that period <0>
{} the ramifications of her affair becomes common knowledge to the family and threatens the marriage a marriage where the husband has done nothing wrong and is if anything too good <0>
marty goes out of his head at the thought of her with another man and will go into an uncontrollable rage feeling the one thing he was most secure about in life has been taken away from him while pearl wrestles with her sense of responsibility and with what she really wants to do <0>
finally she decides not to ride off with walker and live a hippiestyle of life and the superstraight marty decides to loosen up a little and get with the new music coming into vogue <0>
{} the story allows mother and daughter to come to terms freely with who they are as alison has her first period and her first boyfriend and is exploring who she is just like her mother is currently doing <0>
the conflict between mother and daughter reflects on how this particularly volatile time in american history resulted in a sexual revolution and in a generational movement of attitude changes that forced families to face what was in the air at the time or else wide gaps developed in family relationships <0>
{} the moral question the film raises about adultery can only be resolved accordingly by the parties affected and so what happens in the films mild rendering to the problem seems credible at first glance as it is put forth in a way that worked out for the films sake but might not have seemed correct for many a viewer or at least it was not important enough to be resolved by the film even if that clash was supposedly the whole point of the film <0>
{} the acting was convincing the story had a nice feel to it and it followed along with the historical mood the country was going through at that time <2>
the yearnings for a new kind of freedom and to step away from the old boredom of other generations was in the air as a counterculture was constantly being dangled in front of all types <0>
what the film lacked was resolution <-1>
the aim of the film was realized as a small step for a troubled woman feeling the need for passion in her life and getting it via an affair but there were no gigantic aims to be accomplished after pearl takes her gigantic leap into the arms of her hippie lover <0>
i thought that the fleeting affair she had with the longhaired sculptured adonis figure certainly satisfied her sexual needs but the bigger moral question of adultery was never even attempted to be answered with any kind of satisfactory response which left me believing that the liaison was the thing here just like in those romantic pulp fiction books that are an easy read with nothing more to tax your mind <0>

it is also determined that chris is a misfit unable to accomplish even his mundane aim in life to become rich and live in the caribbean <0>
that he is a failure in everything he does even as a hustler blaming all his misfortune on a poorupbringing is never followed through storywise <-1>
that explanation of him doesnt ring true anyway as he always has a blank and uninteresting look on his face and nothing he does throughout the film is taking him to anything but a deadend <0>
so it becomes hard to feel anything for him but pity and contempt <0>
{} the film hit a dry spot for a long while until a pretty schoolage working girl helen geraldine pailhas enters the picture and the threesome play off each others flaws <0>
she livens things up a bit brought into the picture because glover has upped the ante he now wants chris to pick out a woman in the street and murder her and shes the one he picks <1>
{} chris doesnt have it in him to be a coldblooded murderer so he pretends to be killing her so he can collect the huge sum of money offered him to do the job <0>
glover is disappointed in the young man and ends up inviting helen back to the suite for some more fun sic and games <0>
the sadistic games are better delivered now with the presence of helen but the menage a trois doesnt have the nuances wit or actors to pull off the macabre effects it was trying desperately to get away with <0>
and the new rivalry between the girl and boy never amounts to much of a story <0>
{} the film tries to build to a powerful climax <0>
it becomes obvious that glover has a deathwish and has been preparing allthetime for this and now seems ready as he reads from a poem by a zen monk who is about to die which goes something like this in all my years alive ive seen no miracles <0>
it is okay to die today <0>
day after day does not the sun rise in the east <0>
{} but even that attempt to get some life into the story fizzled as the film just wound down trying to outsmart itself with shockers to its denouement but ended up not being a very thrilling thriller or even living up to its reputation of being a controversial film <-1>
it was just a dull exploitive movie distinguished only by the fine performance of a good actor pete postlethwaite who was overwhelmed by being in such a trying film <-1>

{} even though arthur miller wrote this film for marilyn and she was most affecting in this vulnerable role she had this was possibly the best role gable ever had excluding gwtw <2>
he told friends he was working with a bunch of loonies at the time of the films shooting clift was abusing drugs and on the verge of a mental breakdown and arthur and marilyn were experiencing marital woes <0>
also it is interesting to note that this was both clarks and marilyns last film <0>
he died of a heart attack just days after shooting the film <0>
friends say that his rapid loss of pounds to be fit for the film and look good for marilyn may have precipitated the attack though this was denied by the surviving gable family <0>
clark insisted on doing all the rigorous stunts for the film <0>
marilyns supposed suicide came shortly after the film opened <0>
{} the misfits is about some modern day reno denizens who have trouble fitting into society as they question life and their motives for doing what they are doing <0>
gable is the cowboy who is a hard drinker and fast with the women but suffers from an inner melancholy <0>
monroe is the recent divorcee coming to reno to get out of a bad marriage who is oversensitive and is confused about who she is <0>
eli is the second banana to clark who pretends to feel things he doesnt feel expecting to make deals with everyone in order to carry out this charade of good guy but still fails to mask his envy for gable when the chips are down <0>
clift is the honest cowboy hurt by the injustice of life who bemoans the fact that his father died in an accident and left the ranch he loves more than anything else in this world to his mother who has remarried and her new husband has the gall to offer clift wages to work the ranch he once owned <0>
he is now wandering aimlessly on the rodeo circuit and is supposedly the young heroic version of gable <0>
{} marilyn acts as the mother superior to all these men who are attracted to her both physically and spiritually <1>
the film tries to debunk the western myth of rugged individualism by showing how vulnerable they are and how they try to mask their feelings by acting tough <0>
after much verbage the climactic mustang roundup scene culminates in a heavily laden bout of symbolism referring to the cowboy mentality and their need to be free and independent which arthur miller calls as pure poppycock a myth that was created and maintained by those who really dont know what a cowboy life really is like <0>
if you are looking for that kind of western here you will not find it even though you have a director and stars of the film who have been very successful in previous western films depicting that genre as it has come to be expected <0>
there are no heroes here only lonely people trying to live with their illusions just like the audience is trying to see them as they were led to believe cowboys should be like <0>
all this might be confusing for those who never dreamed they would see a western with its stars having psychological problems and worried about earning a living <0>
that sounds too much like what ordinary people are going through <0>
{} this is a superior western despite its nonaction and debunking of one of cinemas great myths mainly because of its incisive characterizations of these misfits and because it was fun watching these big stars work together especially when realizing that there was a lot of truth in the script that pertained to their reallife situations <2>

{} the talented mr ripley offers another screen adaptation of the patricia highsmith novel the first being rene clements purple noon a more straight forward hitchcock type of film that the french actor alain delon couldnt do much with <0>
then there was wim wenders better version the american friend where dennis hopper got into the sinister con mans character and showed how his criminal guilt was related to germanys postwar guilt <0>
this time in a grander and more elaborate version tom ripley damon is a closet homosexual and someone capable of killing anyone who interferes with his plans to assume someone elses identity which makes the crime thriller take on a slightly different meaning from the way highsmith intended it to be perceived she also wrote the novel for the great hitchcock film strangers on a train <1>
for her life had no escapes or false sentimentalities attached to it its just a trap that everyone is in and cant get out of exceptthey can try to make things better for themselves through their cunning ways <0>
{} anthony minghella the english patient will make the theme of the film into an identity crises problem that ripley has and allow the film to become a character study about a sociopath who can complacently say about himself i always thought it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody <0>
he has removed most of the complicated psychological layers of the character and made ripley into a seemingly nicer sort of person the murder he commits is not premeditated as in the novel but comes about when he is provoked beyond what his fragile nature can take <1>
{} ripley is first seen playing the piano in a borrowed princeton insignia blazer he got from the piano player he replaced at a rooftop reception and the ambitious nyc mens room attendant with the ivy league looks is spotted there by herbert greenleaf rebhorn the shipping magnate as he approaches ripley with the thought that he is a college classmate of his sons and comes from the same upperclass strata and he therefore makes a snap decision to have ripley go find his wandering playboy son in italy and urge him to come home <0>
for his troubles he will be paid a thousand dollars and expenses <0>
{} minghella paints a picturesque view of how these rich americans in the late s live as ugly americans in europe as the photography is brilliant with its array of luminous colors from mediterranean places such as san remo palermo roma and venice <1>
the beautiful scenery villas luxurious hotels and splendid boat rides are just right for getting the audience all excited about taking a look at how the smartset travel and spend their leisure time <1>
this fits in nicely with the touristy look of the film <1>
but the story as engrossing as it is can so easily be forgotten when the film ends <-1>
{} this is a big budget miramax film not an arthouse personal film <0>
its magnificent look took away any kind of noir intent the novel might have had if the film was done in the pure form it was written in <-1>
{} the film becomes primarily a character study about ripley and not a film that is too concerned about filling all the holes it has in its plot which are enough to sink a ship <-1>
ripley is unsatisfied with his lot in life and takes this once in a lifetime chance to be with the elite <0>
he manages to engage the manipulative and goodlooking dickie jude in the italian seaside town he is idling away his time in who seems to act more queer than ripley but apparently isnt as he is sexually active with his girlfriend marge gwyneth someone ripley tries to befriend <0>
she just seems to be along for the ride her part is a rather inconsequential one though it is in the same vein as the tiresome parts she usually stars in but here we are at least spared from seeing tears come down her reddened cheeks <-1>
we just see her justifiable petulant anger as she gives ripley that knowing bitchy look of disapproval indicating i know what you did to my dickie <0>
{} ripleys main intent will be to concentrate on absorbing himself in dickies personality and to try to ingratiate himself with the womanizing and capricious wastrel a part that jude does a good job of conveying as he captures the characters nasty mood swings as well as his goofy flippant side <1>
one of the ways ripley endears himself to dickie is sharing in his love for jazz with him even though he is only interested in the music because he knows that dickie is <0>
this friendship built on his telling dickie the reason that his father sent him here will work out well as long as dickie finds him amusing but the relationship soon becomes frayed as dickie becomes irritated with some of his homoerotic gestures and grows tired of his lingering presence around him <0>
{} when asked by dickie what his one talent is ripley names three forger liar and impersonator <0>
as the creepy young man will use his acquired talents to ingratiate himself to his superiors he is seen here as being less a scam artist than he is of being someone trying desperately to fit in where he doesnt belong <0>
when he senses he cant be a hangeron with dickie or dickies crowd anymore he seizes the moment to kill dickie and take his identity as he discovers he has a talent for murder also <0>
{} having already maneuvered his way into dickies crowd but with no great lasting friendships in sight his two greatest successes being with the textile heiress meredith logue cate and the wealthy peter smithkingsley davenport <0>
he met meredith aboard the ship to italy and told her that he is dickie greenleaf and managed to get her to think they are kindred spirits and to have her fall pathetically in love with him <0>
she will turn up at odd moments in his travels and be portrayed as the spoiled rich girl who doesnt know what to do with herself <0>
the trick in this relationship is for ripley to think quickly on his feet so that she will not know that he is an impostor <0>
his other positive relationship will be a homosexual one as peter will know him as ripley and be used by him to cover his murderous tracks <0>
{} the strongest performance in the film comes from freddie miles philip seymour hoffman as an edgy playboy friend of dickies who smells out ripley but just fails to realize how deadly he can be <1>
the scenes with freddie pushed the envelope wideopen and made the average intelligence that ripley possessed diminish in his chilling presence <-1>
hoffmans screen presence sparked keen interest in the story and made it seem more powerful when he was onscreen <1>
when he wasnt onscreen the story wasnt quite as fascinating which made me wonder if he would have been even more suited to play ripley than the bland damon was <-1>
{} as the story gets violently outofhand the pleasure in the film becomes mostly in watching the obvious lies ripley tells when confronted by someone who knows that he is not being straight with them and yet he is shown to still manage to think fast on his feet and come up with a fitting story to put them off his trail <1>
and even if there seems to be little sympathy for the idlerich during ripleys spree there also becomes less and less sympathy for the psychopathic ripley who the filmmaker was insidiously trying to get the viewer to identify with <-1>
{} the only question remaining becomes not why ripley is doing this but whether or not he will get caught <0>
thereby the film loses touch with the character who falls too far from the graces of any rationality for social acceptance who is seen drowning in his own lies and trapped in his own guiltridden nature <-1>
in the novel ripley is more of a longrange scheming sociopath than he is in the film <0>
the new spontaneous twists in the film changes the mood of the story and makes it more creepy but not more endearing <-1>
i think the reason for that is because the matt damon part loses the characters rich rebellious flavor and makes him become less an antihero than viewed as a serial murderer <0>
to fully identify with ripley would require the viewer losing himself totally in the character and seeing the world only through ripleys narcissistic eyes and that is the way minghella probably wanted one to see the film and understand how ripley operated <0>
the problem with that is it simplified all the dark notions of ripleys character and lightened the burden of the story too much trying to make it conform with the s style of film <-1>
as a result this seductive film comes to a conclusion that failed to live up to the gamesmanship offered throughout most of the story <-1>
the film became less meaningful the longer it went on and it ran for minutes <-1>

[17219/d]
{} you can watch this movie that is based on a scifi work by robert heinlein either as a straight gungho war film or you can see it mostly as a spoof <-1>
anyway you watch it wont require too much gray matter from your brain cells because you will either find this film entertaining and a feast for weary eyes or you might like me think that this film is so bad that it really couldnt be this bad i must be missing something <-2>
but i have come to the conclusion that this insipid b movie is that bad despite the high production costs it took to make it <-2>
{} if there are any good parts to this film it might be in the occasional sardonic one liner such as this one that makes light of the films heavy assault on our sensibilities as one soldier is telling the hero of the story youre good at killing bugs <-1>
this came after a big battle between the two opposing armies <0>
{} basically the film should be seen as a war movie because its spoof of the military grew thin very fast for me as it got carried away with the cartoon characters it has stereotyped going for an overkill on a spoof that is so obvious in the first place that by spending so much time with spoofing the military is just plain unnecessary <-2>
it is the last half of the film that takes over the movie anyway as the film becomes all about killing the bugs who have invaded a city called bueno aires <0>
thats the town all our hero kids come from in the story <0>
{} i guess the film is set in the future but it sure looks like the present to me despite all the computer graphics as it makes use of its astronomical budget to become solely a computerized special effect movie that should endear itself to the mtv generation <-1>
there is no subtlety to the continual spoofs against the military personnel <-1>
the mindless story traces a bunch of high school graduates and their dedicated teacher wellacted by michael ironside as they all join the military for all the reasons that prevail at the present time for why people join <0>
{} after awhile all the performers looked alike to me but i wouldnt be doing my duty as a movie reviewer if i should fail to point out that there is some kind of melodramatic love story going down among the four stars of the film rico casper van dien the school football hero loves carmen denise richards the school beauty and math brain who is set on becoming a pilot which is the reason rico joins the military <1>
there is some kind of mumbojumbo talk among them about the difference between a citizen and a civilian a citizen does his duty by joining the military and protecting the federation a civilian makes lots of money and goes to harvard as what ricos folks wanted him to do <0>
the other part of the love story is that dizzy flores dina meyer a football jock and an attractive filly is in love with rico but he spurns her attention <0>
but persistence pays off she joins him in the infantry while carmen falls for her copilot a dude named zander patrick muldoon and the rivalry between rico and zander is about as thrilling as having a spider crawl up your leg <0>
{} i dont think you get much bang for your money out of this film unless you are really into special effects or found this sophomoric satire funny or you are a reactionary then i think you will find many things to like about this empty hearted attempt to put ww into an outer space conflagration film <-2>

[17757/a]
{} a flawlessly made film magnificently acted with beautiful cinematography to go with a compelling story about a school bus accident resulting in the death and injury to all the children on board the bus that tears the heart out of an isolated smalltown in british columbia a story that is very difficult to cover in all the implications it has for the families and ambulance chasing bigcity lawyer mitchell stephens ian involved yet it does do just that as adapted from a russell banks novel and brought to screen not only intact but with a certain forcefulness that reflects the directors ability to dig deeply into the story and make it both accessible and innovatively chilling <2>
{} from the opening scene where ian receives a call on his cell phone while in a car wash from his daughter zoe caerthan who is a druggie in and out of drug clinics for the past years and a disappointment to ian and his separated wife she hates them both equally as she once loved them both equally as a child <0>
she will call him at all hours and their conversations are regrettably filled with rancor though they never stop the relationship completely even though there is no hope for it <0>
something went terribly wrong and either party doesnt know what else to do <0>
one of the most touching and memorable scenes of the film is the distraught ian telling a school chum of zoe while on board a plane to meet zoe how she was bitten by a baby spider when she was and how he rushed her to a hospital miles away prepared to do anything to save her even operate on her in the car with a pen knife if necessary <1>
{} the film does not move along in a linear timeline so it is constantly going back and forth from events leading up to the accident to the perplexed guilt and anger that permeates ians thoughts about his failed relationship with zoe <0>
so when ian arrives at his first potential clients place which is a motel owned by alberta and maury we already know much about the accident and why ian is there and we quickly learn from the couple all the foibles and gossip about the other potential lawsuit clients ian hopes to represent such as the goingons of incest and thievery among his potential clients <0>
later on we learn that the likable good guy of the story billy bruce is having an affair with alberta <0>
{} ian is very intense almost over the edge but he makes sense to these victims and he requires no payment if he loses the case but will be getting of the settlement if he wins <0>
he is able to convince many of the others involved to retain him the others apparently get another lawyer even though there is really no one to blame for the accident it was simply the case of dolores gabrielle the very able driver of the bus driving slowly but still hitting an icy spot on the road and the bus going over the guard rail on the side of the mountain and sinking in the soft ice below <0>
ians argument is that there are no such things as accidents someone must be blamed and if it is not the driver then it could be the bus company that might be apt to cut corners on safety <0>
the important thing is that they need compensation for their grief and anger since their children cant be brought back to life then money will have to do <0>
and this we learn also applies to himself as he considers himself a victim just as much as they are which is why he thinks that he can easily identify with these parents and their grief he has told himself that his daughter is already dead and he thinks this is the way he is to get compensated for his grief <0>
{} in case you didnt get the thrust of the story from that angle the theme of the story is again presented as nicole sarah the baby sitter to billys kids reads them a robert browning nursery poem the pied piper the night before the accident <0>
hes the one who killed all the rats in town and when the town refused to pay him he led all the children in town away except the one who was too lame to follow into a magical place where everything was strange and new <0>
nicole survives the accident but is crippled ruining her chances of being a rock and roller while the kids she baby sat for die <0>
billys habit was to follow the bus to school he loved his kids so much and with his wifes death he loved to wave to them as he drove behind them and they would wave back to him from the back of the bus <0>
thereby he witnessed the accident and felt drained from it especially when he was unable to help as he saw his kids die <0>
{} nicoles parents zealously back the law suit to the regret of billy and nicole <0>
billy vehemently states that this will split the town apart forever that there was no one to blame for it let it be <0>
nicoles reasons are more nefarious it seems ironic that the theme of the poem she read to billys kids will the next day mirror her situation and since she has a poker face she surprises her seemingly loving parents and startled lawyer by lying at the deposition <0>
{} this all adds up to a brilliant film <2>
one of the best of the recent lawyer genre films now being made it is the best one i have seen and the only reason it is not a masterpiece in my opinion is because it was too real something metaphorical about it was lacking i went away from the film intellectually gratified but did not feel the film opened up the emotional wounds of the locals whereas they would see anything more about the tragedy than the fact that their lives had been changed even if some of the locals now question their motives to retain a lawyer and that is now questioned in a way that it has never been questioned before <1>
i have no problem with that aspect of the film that was convincingly conveyed to me as was the lawyers motives who comes across to us as not a good or an evil man he is a man driven and ripped apart by guilt even to the point of exhibiting bizarre behavior as he searches to find a meaning for his life that he doesnt quite understand anymore which is apparently more true than his belief that he is so committed to his work because he is trying to find justice for his clients so what we have what remains for us to ponder is the fact that nothing is as simple as the accident is everyones life has been changed and nothing is the same anymore <0>
but the question that still remains is what has anyone learned from this and that is left lingering because there is an emotional disconnect inbred in the story when all is said and done and we dont know for sure if anything was learned <-1>
nevertheless atom egoyan has created a splendid artistic film <2>
he should be acknowledged by now as one of our greatest living filmmakers <2>

[18087/b-]
{} simply put the renown british artist francis bacon jacobi is not a very nice person <0>
this is a truetolife portrait of one of this centurys most celebrated artists as the film covers his work from the periods of the s through the s as bacons specialty in the macabre is examined as is also his spectacle of what is horrific <0>
but the film offers very little concrete arguments for him to be considered as a great artist we saw none of his paintings on display i realize that this was no fault of the director since bacons estate refused to grant permission for their use <-1>
{} that he is a great artist is of course a debatable subject but what is not subject to debate is the brilliant performance by derek jacobi a virtuoso one and the fine supporting performance by his lover who is the foil for all his nasty wit daniel craig george as both exhibit a forcefulness and a subtly for their character that leaves no doubt that they have mastered their subject rather well leaving no sharp stone unturned so to speak <2>
{} in the very first shot bacon is diabolically smelling the pillow from an obvious lover who just left his flat an image that reminded me so much of hannibal lecter in the silence of the lambs and his extrasensory capacity for smell <0>
{} soon he is confronted with a crashing sound from his skylight flat and there is george dyer a lowerclass london east ender a petty burglar who gets caught by bacon as he is robbing his flat <0>
they immediately become lovers and begin a relationship that mystifies both their circle of friends as georges friends think he has joined up with a bunch of puffs while bacons clique of vipers are titillated to no end by this unholy union as they make sniping remarks directed at how dull george is trying to get the devilish bacon to say what he sees in him even though george will heretofore become the model for bacons decadent and lifeless figures as well as his almost full time lover except when bacon picks up an odd stud or two and locks the hapless george out of the studio flat <0>
he will also generously support george with money and proper clothing and booze <0>
{} that george and he are almost complete opposites able to use each other for whatever it is worth is part of the fascination of the bleak material covered as the film becomes an exercise in excesses and debauchery that is covered so wantoningly with bacon referring to his relationship with george at one point as the man who does odd jobs for him once in a while <1>
{} but somewhere in the seven year relationship between george and bacon bacon tires of him and chooses to let the demise of george become complete without showing one bit of concern for him <0>
this should not be too surprising because he proudly tells us that he is optimistic about nothing and finds beauty in the suffering and bloodshed of others such as at a car accident relating how it excites him to see the bodies lie randomly on the road and at a professional fight we see how he nearly has an orgasm in public when he gets splattered with the boxers blood <0>
{} that his precarious lifestyle often shines as brightly as his visual images as his oeuvre of work is presented to us through these visions rather than seeing it as on framed paintings and this is stupendously done by a brilliant stroke of filmmaking as the artists soul was seen crawling out of the recesses of his warped but talented mind as distorted lenses and mirrored images and shaded colorings and quick editing of the images were all effectively used to enhance the eeriness of the artists visions <2>
{} the nonlinear story is transcribed for the most part either in bacons studio or in the bar where his circle of friends hold court as bacon who is the submissive one in sex is the ever aggressive and dominant one with both his sham friends as he notes realistically what they are to him and his george who foolishly tells him that he loves him and is quickly admonished with the following put down from the master from what bad tv show did you get that from <0>
{} i must confess i never cared for bacons art though i was somewhat impressed with the raw power of his blood curling images and the deathlike objectivity he gives his work <0>
but i was put off with his inability to reach farther back into the human soul and see what the whole being is like as the truly great artists such as a blake or durer can who know both good and evil <0>
to know one of the contraries is not enough as it probably means that you cant even see that as clearly as you should as in bacons case what evil is for him to see is mostly felt as a raging flux inside something jacobi captured on screen that made this film a very special one and saved it from the doldrums it could have been <1>
it is rare that an actor can really sense the mood and spirit of an artist because when he doesnt it is to the detriment of the film no matter how good the story is or who the artist is that is being portrayed <0>
what comes to my mind is the risible performances of charlton heston as micheangelo and kirk douglas as van gogh or more recently leonard di caprio trying to be convincing as an unknown artist in titanic <0>
their lack of credibility as artists were enough to make the films they were in seem phony <0>
off hand i can only think of derek jarmans caravaggio to match this one in intensity and homosexuality and integrity of performance <2>
{} but whatever i think of bacon and his art work or the unwatchable moments this film had and the pangs i got from his negative philosophy and how the story was going down a culdesac i was nevertheless still dazzled by a performance from derek jacobi that left me breathless and by a first time director who is in every mannerism an artist and feels like an artist does and was able to translate that inspiration onto the screen which is no easy feat to do <2>

[17534/b+]
{} this is raimis attempt to go mainstream with an art film thriller that might have an appeal to an audience that likes films that give them some ideas to ponder <0>
this wintry morality tale its bleak snowbound midwestern atmosphere reminds me a lot of fargo without the comedy as it examines the character of three small town locals who have no worldly experience but have adjusted in one way or another to their lot in life <0>
{} hank mitchell paxton figured out that it is the simple things in life that make one happy and hes a lucky man because he got everything he basically wants a pregnant wife that he loves a respectable job in a feed store a college education a home and the respect of the townspeople where he has lived all his life <0>
his brother jacob thornton is his opposite a born loser he cant hold a job has never even kissed a woman drinks heavily is uneducated and lacks all his wits nevertheless he gets by satisfied to be living a rather plain and childlike life satisfied to go hunting and chat with someone who talks his talk his crony lou brent a married yearold who is unemployed the town drunk a high school dropout and of a volatile nature <0>
{} their three lives would change forever when chance intervenes and they find a crashed plane buried in the snow with million dollars <0>
the question arises what should the three of them do with the money <0>
{} hank the responsible one of the trio decides that they better come up with a plan a simple plan and that if they dont want to turn the money over to the police which is what he suggests they do then they must agree to let him keep the money until the spring so that when the plane is discovered they will at least know if this is stolen money <0>
{} the trio are all perfectly cast with billy bob thornton in a supporting role becoming caught with his brother in a series of bad judgments that results in the most terrible consequences for them <1>
billy bob is particularly outstanding in his truetolife characterization of such an individual <2>
{} sarah bridget makes the most of her small role as the rational wife who gets involved with her husbands plans and connives to help him alter his plans <0>
but as a result her interference makes things worse <0>
{} things get completely outofcontrol for the trio as things turn awfully bloody <0>
this is a dilemma for the filmmakers there seems to be something devoid about this tale that cant surface except in outwardly visual terms as we clearly see how morality is drawn in terms of black and white <0>
there is the great shot of the snow in all its whiteness and the black crows surrounding the downed plane as this sighting of where the money is seems to be a symbol for the films morality play <1>
{} the result of all the trios bungling is that things are no longer simple for them as greed and their extended version of the american dream but this time earned the too easy way via a suitcase full of money found in the snow becomes too much for them to handle with any sensibility as all their character flaws become magnified and they begin to get careless and talk too much of what they found <0>
jacobs character ranges between vulnerability and menacing danger as the bonds between brothers is tattered and redefined for ever as the brothers must face up to who they really are and how they will both relate to lou as even the placid and morally proper hank has begun to spiral downward almost lost in a nightmare he no longer has control of <0>
{} this is a strong gutwrenching suspense film one of the top ten of <2>
but the film is just lacking something and i think that thing it needed was a breath of vagueness about what is morally right or wrong in order for the story to remain on an even psychologicalspiritual keel and not descend into a literal biblical morality theme <-1>
raimi did a superb visual job carefully weaving a noir tale without any heroes or apparent villains a difficult task to do but one that he succeeds in without question <2>
my feeling is that in due time we will look back at this film and wonder how it was overlooked by so many as it will become recognized as one of the great suspense classics <2>

{} how receptive you are to this welltold but unoriginal and very sentimental brazilian film about a miscreant old woman named dora fernanda a former teacher and now a letter writer in the central station of rio and a yearold orphaned boy josue vinicius whose mother has just been run over by a bus as she leaves the letter writer after writing a letter asking her drunken husband who abandoned her and the kid years ago to get back with them again depends on how much you mind being jerked around as if you were on a chain and could be pulled on it at any time <-1>
{} though i gladly admit i enjoyed viewing the unusual road scenes in the desolate brazilian countryside where the people are poor ignorant superstitious and craving for a religion that gives them some form of hope for their dismal lives <1>
this former documentary film director ably showed how religion can be as phony as the government that keeps most of the people impoverished <0>
in any case this was a place where tourists dont visit and films about this kind of brazil are rarely seen by a foreign audience <0>
{} therefore for me the strongest point of the film is the documentary type of cinematography that went into the parched brazilian countryside making the barren land throb with life <1>
the most exciting shots were reserved for the religious pilgrimage the two weary travelers stumbled into as they were caught in the light coming from the bright torches of the believers as the two wanderers search for themselves in the darkness of the night <1>
that was pure cinematic magic <1>
{} ultimately this is a road film as dora relents from her hatred of the kid as she changes her mind after selling the kid to some unscrupulous people who will sell him for adoption <0>
an adoption that could lead to unimaginable medical experiments done on the child <0>
she decides to risk her life to get him out of those unscrupulous hands and take him to the father who may not even be where the kid thinks he lives <0>
a theme that has been done before sometimes much better as in landscape in the mist <-1>
{} the film emphasized the builtin misery the heroine has that made life for her to be a grind but there seemed to be something special about her that the actress was able to bring out from her characterization that made her seem better than what she appeared to be <0>
the only friend she had for company was her unmarried friend irene pera a much kinder and happier person than she who could have been a prostitute the film did not make that clear it only hinted at that <0>
{} the beauty of this tale is not in the story itself if there is a beauty in the tale but in the way it affected the two main characters dora and josue as they eventually find something in themselves that they didnt know they had and they learn how to deal with the bitternesss in their life <-1>
their experience was comparable to a religious awakening <0>
these two rotten apples turn out to be not so bad after all <0>
how much you like the film depends on how believable you find the transformation that is about to take place for these characters <0>
{} for me it was too much sentimentality and an uninspiring and contrived plot that kept me from warming up to the story <-1>
that the woman being transformed from a spiteful person who made fun of the letter writers and despised children will become transfixed from an ugly duckling mad at the world to an almost angelic figure someone capable of bringing great joy to the world was too much for me to accept all at once <-2>
the story turned out just too goodygoody for my taste <-2>
i do not trust films that are so contrived there is something about them that remains phony that good acting can only mask just so much of that phoniness <-2>
and the acting by montenegro was grand she is the film along with the fine cinematography but even that is not enough to completely overcome such a stale story <-1>

{} i was disappointed in hartleys most ambitious film to date i expected more than what was delivered <-1>
the story is interesting enough about a passive sexually repressed garbageman named grim urbaniak who is content with his sullen life and a disheveled drifter named henry fool ryan who we learn later on in the film has been released from prison for child rape <1>
he is articulate full of mischievous zest a scoundrel passing himself off as an undiscovered writer <0>
he influences urbaniak to write down his thoughts every day and edits his work and after they are posted on a local delis bulletin board a high school newspaper prints the poems and grim gets a cult following <0>
and as urbaniak starts to become known through the internet and eventually wins the nobel prize henry recedes to domesticity and obscurity <0>
he also seduces urbaniacs nymphomaniac sister parker who manages not to be as funny as she ordinarily is this is no fault of hers the script is not that funny for her part <0>
he also seduces parkers mother <0>
{} henry fool can best be viewed as an allegory of the goodguys nonconformist versus the bad guys the establishment <0>
for hartley aficionados his comedy is still there in flashes his trademark drone conversations and absurd situational humor a marriage proposal takes place between henry and parker while he is taking a wicked dump this is the best and most powerful scene in the film <1>
but the film is boring at times and belabors its points and goes on for too long without seeming to be moving with a spark of credibility or in any one direction and is at best an uneven attempt to say something serious which hartley should be applauded for <-2>
but the film gets bogged down in telling too many different stories such as one of domesticity neighborhood values and the business of getting published <-1>
{} i wanted to like this film and i thought about why i didnt feel comfortable viewing it for a long time after seeing the movie and i still found that what i got from the film were some chuckles from the zany characters but what i was not clear about was what else i was supposed to get from this film <-2>
it just didnt add up as a work of drama it failed to provide a proper tension between plot and character <-2>

{} a very funny spoof about a colorful couple who must have a child and will try to get one by any means possible <1>
the coen brothers know how to push the right comedy buttons as they stereotype a lowclass couple and move them over the edge <1>
h i cage is an habitual incompetent criminal specializing in convenience store robberies where he gets caught but receives light sentences because his gun is never loaded <0>
ed holly is the prison officer who takes his picture every time he enters the prison and after his third stay in the same prison she decides to accept his proposal and marry him <0>
through the use of a voiceover emanating from h i as the narrator the logical sequence of the story is followed <0>
{} distraught when she is told by her doctor that she is barren and can never have children ed is even further upset that she cant adopt because of her husbands extensive prison record <0>
h i since his release has gone straight working at an industrial job and living in a trailer on the outskirts of tempe arizona as the coen brothers raise the question of how long this habitual criminal can go on being a normal family man before he reverts to his old habits <0>
{} with news of quints born to a wealthy owner of the largest chain of unpainted furniture stores in arizona nathan arizona sr trey the couple reasons that it is unfair that some have so much while others have so little <0>
so to balance things out they kidnap one of the quints the photogenic nathan arizona jr kuhn and bring him home <0>
{} armed with dr spocks book on how to raise the child they are the very perfect picture of doting parents and a nuclear family <0>
but their bliss is shortlived as two of h i s prison mates escape and come knocking on his door at am <0>
gale goodman and evelle forsythe want to stay but ed insists they are a bad influence on h i and for their baby and wants them to leave at once but is talked into letting them stay for a few days <0>
h i is visited by a socalled normal family his foreman and friend glen mcmurray and his fasttalking wife dot mcdormand who have a household filled with adopted children <0>
they unleash their herd of uncontrollable adopted children onto the mcdonnough house and it results in slapsticklike comedy as it ridicules these families for wanting children but thinking of them as ideals not aware that they are real people <0>
{} the film has its moments of serious pauses as h i is filled with dreams of what should be right and wrong in life <0>
he also has fatalistic nightmares <0>
one of his nightmares materializes in the person of a heavily armed biker from what seems like hell leonard smalls cobb <0>
he is a man tracker who wants more than the reward nathan arizona offered to get his baby back as he fails to make a deal with the magnate but not before threateningly telling him that he will get the baby <0>
{} there are a few more complications along the way as h i goes berserk at glens suggestion that they do a wife swapping thing and then punches his dim boss in the nose which gets him fired <0>
when glen figures out who the baby is he tells h i he wont turn him over to the police and collect the reward only because his wife wants the baby <0>
the other complication is that the fugitives realize who the baby is and how valuable he is and they take him from the couple <0>
{} there is a flat scene where the fugitives are robbing a bank and not knowing what to do with baby nathan take him into the bank they are robbing <0>
here the comedy was predictable chevy chase sort of material <-1>
{} the coen brothers know how to make a quirky film and they sure know how to write sidesplitting dialogue <2>
and if you are looking for something heavier like a lesson to be gotten from all this or a searing comment on society maybe you could even find that here also <1>
though sometimes the comic situations and the way all the characters talk funny seem forced it still recovers from these lapses and bounces back with more offthewall situations once reserved for keystone cop comedies like ferocious dogs chasing the hero improbable victories for our improbable hero while fighting goliaths and store clerks who have hidden vengeance inside them <2>
if it is absurd comedy that makes you do cartwheels something that is unique and dark enough to have some bite in it then this film is funny enough to overcome some of its failing moments <2>

{} an emboldened narrative that weaves a tale around the embittered characters who live in juneau alaska and struggle to make ends meet and keep their lives in check <0>
they are in a precarious state of limbo between the natural beauty of the unspoiled last frontier of alaska and the increasing commercialism where developers want to turn the state into a theme park <0>
{} the three main characters are caught in their own psychological states of limbo as fate has made life a tough go for them <0>
they are a former fisherman and a former local high school basketball star around fifty years old now working as a handyman but who has the opportunity to fish again jumping joe gastineau david strathairn <0>
then there is donna de angelo elizabeth mastrantonio a fortyish singer who reminds one a lot of judy collins but who has not reached the pinnacle of her profession and is forced to eke out a living singing in lounges across states and the territory of puerto rico <0>
she travels to these jobs with her sensitive and resentful teenage daughter who is gifted in writing stories and is an aspiring writer noelle vanessa martinez <0>
she is bewildered by her life and feels unwanted and unloved not understanding how her mother keeps making wrong choices in the men she picks for boyfriends and why her real father a musical composer is unheard from <0>
her anger and disenchantment with life causes her to perform acts of selfmutilation <0>
{} they are really nice people who each have a story to tell how they got trapped by their circumstances and how they reacted to it <0>
donna is the optimist who even when she realizes that her career is going nowhere still sometimes feels the songs she is singing hook onto her and sometimes that energy revitalizes her and gives her the warm smile she is capable of having inspite of all the set backs in her life <0>
{} joe is much more reticent and taken aback by the demise of his once promising life that went suddenly downhill through unforeseen circumstances <0>
as a college basketball player he blew out a knee and lost his scholarship to a california university returning to juneau to work on his own charter boat where he had a terrible accident when he and his two best friends got drunk and while they were sleeping the boat capsized and he couldnt save his friends plus he lost his boat and means of earning a living <0>
this was too much for him to handle and he lost his will to go on living withdrawing from people and his life as a fisherman <0>
{} for noelle her childhood is a bad memory and to try to make sense out of it she makes up stories almost sharing the same downtrodden view of life that joe has <0>
and when she sees her mother leave her latest goodfornothing boyfriend and fall for the quiet nice guy who is an avid reader of books and also a rugged outdoorsman it strikes her to be unfairly strange that she also had a crush on him <0>
{} what is noteworthy about the telling of the story is how earnest and real their situation is and how magnificently graceful the actors are slowly revealing the sore points and tender sides of their troubled souls <2>
this part of the film is played out against the background of an alaska being ravaged for business interest where the locals are being squeeezed out of their livlihoods <0>
but this is a land of dreams where hope is everpresent even for those who spend their time in the colorful local saloon whiling their time away with their own long stories <0>
{} the subplots that develop connect somehow with the main characters in an effortless way <0>
the veteran fisherman and angry former boat owner working in a fishing processing plant that is closing down harmon king burmester rails against what is happening to him and to alaska as he confronts the lesbian couple whom he lost his boat to in a business deal gone wrong <0>
but the two cant even come close to understanding each others side <0>
this is the same boat that joe is able to charter as he gets back to his love for fishing <0>
it seems whatever you do in modern alaska you have to hurt someone or something whether intentionally or not <0>
sayles plays upon the theme of the two alaskas one of the untapped future which romantically holds visions of the beautiful wilderness the other is the state where tourists come to hear stories about the past from the safety of a stagnant civilization <0>
{} the first part of the story draws the kindred spirits together as joe and donna seem on their way to finding some happiness together that their romanticism will prevail and that they will not succumb to the pessimism that surrounds them <0>
but joes much younger halfbrother bobby siemaszko shows up after a long time of them not seeing each other and the two who never lived under the same roof and never had the same interests in life but still maintained a distant but cordial relationship talk about the father they had who could not love them <0>
bobby innocently gets joe to go out with him on his charter boat concocting some story about meeting some businessmen and wanting to appear as the head of a business himself so he needs joe to act as a captain while he acts as an admiral <0>
joe uses this opportunity to lure donna and her daughter out to sea so he can get to know her better <0>
{} the second part of the story takes a troubling turn as the illfated trio runs into a worst karma situation than theirs that of bobby <0>
they end up stranded on a deserted island with little hope of being rescued as bobby is shot by the drug dealers enforcers after a drug deal bobby was involved in didnt work out right <0>
they now must learn how to survive together as their journey into the interior of the alaskan wilderness takes away all the glamor of living away from civilization <0>
{} here the three of them realize how unprepared they are for life in the wilderness finding a brokendown abandoned shed to keep warm at night and signaling for help on an island where no one would logically come looking for them <0>
the ending of the film is problematic and inconclusive though it seems apparent that they are doomed <-1>
smilin jack kris kristofferson finds them with his small seaplane but cant take them with him as he tells joe that he was hired by two people to find them <0>
he leaves them there with a faint hope that he will act in a conscionable way <0>
smilin jack is the brother of one of those who was drowned in joes boat something that this maverick drug smuggler has never forgiven joe for <0>
the film ends with a plane returning the next day and the lingering question is is it a rescue plane or one with the gunmen aboard <0>
their fate is tied to how the unscrupulous smilin jack ultimately feels about them <0>
{} many viewers will be disappointed that there is no payoff in the story <0>
{} the film was well served by a capable cast and even if its story bit off a lot of ground to chew a lot more than it was capable of fully digesting too many topics from environmental issues to dysfunctional families it was still good storytelling <1>
but it did try to get too clever with the plot allowing every angle of the characters problems to fit too nicely together there was too much of a parallel symbolism of the castaways relating to their three lives that was too neat for its own good <-1>
for instance noelle is no longer isolated from her mother and is forced into accepting her mothers love joe has another chance of saving two people who couldnt before <0>
but this is topped by thought provoking storytelling one that was visually stunning as well as accomplished with mature dialogue <1>
{} the film didnt always work as melodramatics seemed to take away from the tremendous drive the story had on its own merits as a straight romantic tale <-1>
but what kept it compelling was the human drama that made me want to think that the trio had found something on their journey that they didnt realize that they had before <1>
in any case one can bank on a john sayles film lone star matewan passion fish men with guns being interesting and provoking <1>
though the unresolved ending to the film might bother some viewers that of being in a state of limbo is not the worst way in which to end a film especially one where the storytelling itself is the aspect of the film that veers from guarded hope to fatalism where each of the characters is seen on this deserted island as not being able to run away from their problems anymore <1>

{} how many other directors could handle with great deftness the innuendoes of this potentially sexually explosive relationship between an attractive and problematic widow with a young daughter emmanuelle and a handsome yearold priest belmondo during the german occupation of a small french town <2>
melville establishes his exquisite control of the subject matter by allowing the story to unfold in such a perfect manner <2>
i suspect not many directors have that kind of grace and understanding of life <2>
melvilles sense of how to tell a story has influenced many directors through his long career starting in the late s and that list would include the great director bresson who developed the same style and feel for filmmaking as melville who at times outdoes melvilles melville giving some the false impression that melville imitated bresson <2>
{} melvilles success comes through the intelligent use he makes of his eye for seeing what is spiritual and what is intelligent and allowing it to be emotionally compelling <2>
his characterization of the occupation and how some survived it by becoming collaborators with the germans or by becoming part of the black market or by becoming part of the resistance movement is accomplished by relating the priest to all that goes on in town and how the priest brings out his ideas of what god is and how tolerance is the message of all sane people even as the horrors of what the nazis stand for is glossed over in the background its evil is still felt by those who must live under them meanwhile melville is connecting the religious needs of the community and the deportation of the jews with the personal savior jesus christ who he reminds us died as a jew <0>
the implication being for those who think that because they are christians they dont have to be concerned about what is happening to the jews are sorely mistaken because they have forgotten who christ is and how he died for everyone and how if he was around today he would be a jew taken away to the death camps <0>
the priest sees his task in life as a fulfillment of his christian vows by helping those who need to be helped no matter what they believe in <0>
he appeals especially to the women in town as a sort of modern day christ that results in some very complex emotional questions being raised relating to mundane matters and affairs of the heart and spiritual quests <0>
{} belmondos performance as a priest who questions authority and is not afraid of what others might think is superb as he attracts many women practitioners especially leaving himself vulnerable to public opinion when he openly maintains a very close relationship with the widow <2>
his argument for a god couldnt be put forth with more verve and intelligence even though it didnt convince me as he was not challenged with counter arguments by any one in the film who had the ability to present a cogent differing opinion nevertheless this film moved me to further expand what i think <1>
it even shows that it is possible to have a truly spiritual person be a part of the church something that i have rarely come across outside the cinema <1>

{} alan trouble in mind choose me moderns rudolphs offbeat film has the look and feel of bad melodrama using overexaggerated action sequences to spin a convoluted yarn maybe a parody about twins born to a ballerina who had an affair with a european aristocrat and is forced into giving them up for adoption when he wants no part of her <-2>
they are separated at birth taking different paths in life henry petosa matthew modine grows up to be a shy nerdy fearful and unambitious garage mechanic in his adoptive he doesnt know that hes adopted fathers m emmett walsh garage who spends his spare time watching selfdefense programs on tv and pining away for his best friend russells nervously played by kevin j oconnor emotionally insecure sister beverly lara flynn boyle who reads emily dickenson aloud to herself <0>
he modestly lives in a tenement that happens to be in a bad neighborhood <0>
the brother he doesnt know exists is freddy ace also played by modine who is a smalltime hood ambitiously working himself up the ladder of the protection racket run by a vicious hood mr paris fred ward doing the driving and also doing a coldblooded hit job for the boss <0>
he is always seen with a perfectly moussedhairstyle and is married to a beautiful but shallow woman lori singer having two children and living in a luxurious apartment all these things are status symbols which show that he has come a long way from the orphanage he was raised in <0>
{} an old bag lady with a tattoo on her arm saying to my dearest helena dies on the fictional city streets clutching a letter stating that she is the mother of twins and that the father of the children left it is now worth million dollars for them in a swiss trust fund that can only be accessed by the password equinox <0>
the title of the film as defined will refer to the equality of the light and dark sides during an equinox <0>
this symbolizes the qualities the twins must confront in their nature which only henry is able to do <0>
{} the letter is found by an ambitious hospital worker sonya kirk uninterestingly played by tyra who aspires to be a writer and thinks this will make a great story <0>
she weaves this ambiguous tale or spoof or whatever it is together <0>
as all the quirky characters will somehow fit into the story and by the end of the film i guess there is supposed to be some hidden message as henry stands alone looking down at the tremendous depths of the grand canyon <0>
{} there was also a ridiculous scene with a hooker named rosie tomei who lives in henrys tenement and is being abused by her pimp dudley <0>
she will service henry as a payment for watching her baby <0>
there was one stupid line she said to him that made me laugh primarily because it was so stupid youre not going to catch nothing from me but your breath <-1>
{} in fact the only enjoyment i derived from all the banal dialogue and its embarrassing story if it wasnt a parody then its a horrible script and if it is a parody it doesnt work the story is too ambiguous was the b movie oneliners that kept coming throughout the film <-1>
since thats the only thing i liked about this film ill drop a few of them on you freddy to another gangster never miss a good chance to shut up <1>
one gangster talking to another i was so popular in high school everybody hated me <0>
ill mention two quotes mr petosa gives us from his vaudeville shtick he seemed to be doing for his characterization if money didnt grow on trees how come banks have so many branches and chaste makes waste <1>
henry tritely says my whole life seems to be taking place without me in it <1>
freddy when asked if he is happy replies id be a lot happier with a million bucks and a full tank of gas <0>
paris says to freddy after he knocks off their associate richie tate richie had no brains and he was stupid <1>
beverly to henry which is the most pertinent line in the film banal as it is your whole life is searching for one thing and all that other stuff just fades away <1>
{} i dont know what the story is supposed to mean maybe its just a searchforidentity kind of film maybe its an updated fairytale about the prince and the pauper as one critic suggests <-1>
but i found it to be muddled unfunny and the acting is so lame especially matthew modines overacting that it is almost unbearable to watch <-2>
but i got a kick out of those stupid oneliners from all the zanies trying so hard to be to be zany and there was something intangible about the film that made you keep watching it hoping there was something there that you missed seeing <1>
so at least its an original film a passable one at that with a lot of possibility to it and it is done in the bizarre auteur style this filmmaker likes to operate in <1>

[17391/c+]
{} elmore leonard novels have become staples for the movies in recent times they become movies easily translated into money making glossy thrillers noted for their amusing dialogue and smartly made stories <2>
this film is no exception <2>
it is entertainment for those who like fun pictures placing no other demands on the filmmaker <1>
{} clooney and lopez work well together there is a chemistry between them on screen that belies the unbelievability of the story they are in <1>
clooney is jack foley antihero hero nonviolent bank robber robbed banks with just a smile a real smoothy but he gets caught robbing a bank and is sent to jail in florida but escapes <0>
jennifer lopez is karen sisco federal marshal who happens to witness the jail break and is taken hostage by jack and his buddy buddy ving who is driving the getaway car <0>
they throw her into the trunk of the car and jack joins her striking up a friendly conversation while gently caressing her thigh in the tight quarters they are in <0>
the magical attraction between these two is very cleverly highlighted in this scene <1>
{} jack and buddy are off to detroit to score a diamond robbery something jack got wind of behind bars as a crooked weasely wall streeter richard ripley albert brooks blabbed to another prisoner that he has million in uncut diamonds stashed away in his house <0>
the only thing keeping jack from being in wintry detroit and going through with the heist is that he wants to romance karen <0>
she is intent on arresting him and moving up the ladder in the f b i chain of command <0>
but to complicate matters she is also taken with his good looks and charm <0>
{} the cast is fine <1>
steve zahn plays glenn and is as funny as hell as a drugged out thief <0>
don cheadle is vicious as snoopy miller excon and detestable prisonmate of jacks <0>
dennis farina is pleasantly sardonic as karens dad and confidante <0>
{} the film is violent it is sexy it has romance and comedy in it in fact it has just about everything in it except real intelligence but then again what results is a quickpaced actioner that is easy to watch and easy for the viewer to let his hair down a bit and be less critical for this film is a wellconceived star vehicle that works on all cylinders of the entertainment scale <1>

[18161/c]
{} a very bitter love story unfolds reflecting on the breakup of a seemingly happy marriage by circumstances that seemed odd and inexplicable unless it is true that certain people cant handle their happiness and have to do something to screw that up <0>
the stars of the film who play a married couple are probably playing out on screen a lot of what their married life was like before their reallife divorce <0>
paul gauff philippe his exwife danielle gegauff esther and their daughter clemence gauff elsie are the stars of the film <0>
{} an odd thing occurred after the movie was made paul gauff chabrols favorite screenwriter was stabbed to death in by his second wife <0>
{} this film has both the look of a daytime tv soaper and a cheapie movie <-2>
it never develops into anything more than it starts out to be no matter how the story turns it can only be a twisted psychological tale depicting a couple living on the outskirts of paris with him being the very erudite and upperclass teacher of life to his attractive but unsophisticated peasant born wife <-2>
one day he tells his wife that he had six affairs that didnt mean anything to him during their ten years of marriage and when she is forced to tell him that she never had an affair he insists that she have an affair with an arab guitar player named habib someone he doesnt even like <0>
i cant begin to explain why he does that unless he is so arrogant and bored with life that he feels he has to do it <-1>
that he loses his wife after she has a number of sexual encounters with her new lover should not be particularly surprising <0>
{} how chabrol handles this volatile material is what brings even more vagueness to the story then he usually brings to his stories as he concentrates on philippes changing psychological states that vary from being a doting father to his cute daughter to being a vile bully to his wife <-1>
as things change for the worse in their marriage the couple give up their rented house in the country and move back to the city as paris offers them a chance to change and grow intellectually and emotionally <0>
she takes a job as a publicist with habibs musical company <0>
it is not really clear how philippe earns his money but he is involved in some kind of business dealings with his friends <0>
the tables are now turned on him as he angrily and jealously pursues his wife who continues to see habib as he disparages her taste disapproving that she hangs around with his superficial philosopher friends who dont even read what they are bullshitting about and he becomes terribly disappointed that she falls for that group <0>
their breakup is now for real <0>
so what does the lovesick philippe do but meet a scottish lady paula moore sylvia murdoch who has been divorced three times and one of her former husbands is habib <0>
philippe quickly marries her but soon is pained by the sweet memories of esther and once again seeks esther out <0>
{} i found enough interest in this film to say that it is not completely without merit <1>
but i did not think it told a crisp enough story to make it anything but one of chabrols experimental soso films <-2>
the demise of philippe the failure of him to let his wife be who she is without letting go of his tyrannical hold on her made him an unsympathetic character from the beginning to the end of the story <0>
for the film to say that men always ask questions and women dont is not exactly a modern attitude to have these days <-1>
and it was unclear to me what chabrols thinking about this really was whether it was an ironical attitude or a stab at saying something that was so ridiculous that no one could take it seriously <-1>
chabrol has made a career out of being vague in his films and more often than not it has worked to his benefit but not this time <-2>

[17243/c-]
{} wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you <1>
you can see its plot developing from a mile away <-1>
you are lured into its benign story of a single yearold girl looking for a soul mate in boston as that city is depicted as a miniwonderland for singles <0>
this is a star oriented film and the star who carries the film is erin hope davis <0>
that this is a dating film about singles who for reasons of fate or luck or whatnot have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers is nothing new this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films <0>
the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film <-1>
the main quirk in the plot here is that hopes pushy mother hollan visits her in boston sees her daughters livein relationship with a radical protester hoffman breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her harvard medical school dropout daughter who works as a nurse <0>
this is done without her knowledge <0>
it is cornball sitcom stuff but at least it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director <-1>
{} it is easy to like erin she is bright caring and attractively blonde <1>
it is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with the financially strapped ruggedly handsome intelligent yearold alan alan who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist <1>
of course he comes across as being so good though he does kill some fish in the aquarium that it is hard to believe hes for real or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for <0>
the contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as the subway at a restaurant or on the phone <0>
{} alans brother answers erins ad with a few of his pals as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her that the others witness will win the bet <0>
this subplot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told <-1>
{} that we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are each one more annoying than the other culminating in the most obnoxious one of all that brazilian lover jose who is about as charming as a snakeoil salesman who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story <0>
{} anyway as expected alls well that ends well for this watchable piece of fluff that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its storyline <1>
the dialogue was actually not bad those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation <1>
and oh by the way wonderland refers to the stop on the boston metro it is where greyhound racing takes place <0>

{} pi is an earnestly written and directed lowbudget black white shot scifi film that is made for intellectuals but shows them in a depressing light <0>
it is about a mathematically gifted intellectual gullette and his obsession as a computer freak with predicting the exact performance of every stock and later on when he meets an hasidic numerologist shenkman he is intrigued to find out if a string of digits is the mystery number that will reveal gods true name <0>
this curious story also concerns the price he must pay for his relentless pursuit of knowledge he shuns people and lives stoically and suffers from poor mental and physical health <0>
his severe anxiety attacks bring on frightening illusionary visions that require him to ply himself with an assortment of drugs <0>
the attacks he gets on the nyc subway are particularly horrifying such as being followed and seeing a brain on the subway platform <0>
{} pi is the mathematical symbol for the ratio of the circumference of a circle <0>
its number has served the public well for generations <0>
but our hero is rebellious of this symbols status quo in society <0>
for him the mystery of numbers are the most important thing in his life more important than being happy <0>
gullettes life is wrapped around three principles math is the language of nature all things can be understood through numbers and there are patterns in nature <0>
{} gullettes life comes apart when evil wall streeter brokers wish to use his knowledge for their profit and hasidim wish to use his knowledge to access god <0>
he terms himself a jew who doesnt believe in religion <0>
he considers his search as pure science and has no interest in making a profit off his knowledge or in knowing god <0>
but his pursuit of knowledge misses a fundamental point his mentor and former professor at columbia margolis share a mutual interest in such data derived from numbers <0>
they play go and discuss the problems they run into in their work after gullettes computer crashes and he loses his valuable data on the numbers he is working on the professor tries unsuccessfully to warn him of the dangers of getting too absorbed in his work so much so that he reaches a point where he cant see the obvious <0>
margolis futilely shouts out that he should go home and relax and take a bath that he thinks too much he should learn how to act more intuitively <0>
{} the flaw in this intellectualual characterization of gullette is that the director chooses to end gullettes vision and search by saying it is not so bad that he took out a piece of his brain because of all the problems he was having now he can experience the ordinary things of life <-1>
aronofsky did not take a stand to point out what he clearly meant by that that is unless he believes it is better to be selfsatisfied and rational than someone who goes all the way in his pursuit of genius <-1>
what is clear is that aronofsky blames science just as much as he does capitalism and religion for the way the world is in turmoil <0>
{} this is aronofskys first feature something he won best director for at the sundance film festival <0>
it is good to see that a film that is so cerebral and difficult to make can so popularly be received by selected audiences and most critics <1>
but this being said the films popularity still scares me i think it is popular for the wrong reason <-1>
this film in retrospect might be viewed as an antiintellectual film since it emphasizes that gullette is more appealing when he is not completely absorbed in his intellectual pursuit <0>
just as the films merits are easy to praise the films flaws are easy to find fault with <-1>
aronofsky has his protagonist retreating sophomorically into passivity in lieu of his quest this flaw should not be overlooked it so seriously challenges the films main character from establishing who he is and from our understanding of what is really being said about intellectuals <-2>
i think it should have been emphasized that it is irrelevant that the protagonist is an intellectual because he could be any personality type and that would not alter the fact that he was going through a nervous breakdown and in essence that is what has happened to gullette who is just marvelous in this very complex role in a film that gives off a rich aroma of intellectual pursuit but cannot digest the full intellectual and mystical meal it has cooked <-1>

{} a german lieutenant werner von ebrennac vernon is stationed in france during the time of the occupation and moves into the rural village cottage of an elderly scholarly gentleman robain and his niece nicole <0>
they take a vow of silence toward the german intruder sitting by their fireplace night after night when the officer returns from his duty never saying a word to him during his entire stay with them <0>
the officer never shows his animosity towards them as he uses their silence to fill in details about what he is thinking his love of music his life story the girl he almost married his love of french culture and his belief that this occupation will be good for both countries he says it will be like a marriage <0>
his political naivety in civilian life he is a musical composer and underestimation of the evil government he represents comes to light for him when he meets with close friends who are in paris to negotiate the political arrangement between the two countries <0>
it is then that he is shocked into realizing the barbaric designs that are intended by them to reduce the world to be submissive to a dominant germany the aim being to rip the soul out of each country it conquers <0>
his more benevolent ideas for the mutual countries to coexist are sneered at by his cultured german friends <0>
fed up with this but resigned to the fact that there is nothing he could do about it he volunteers for duty in the war zone of ww <0>
{} the old man has left a copy of one anatole frances books out for him to see just as he leaves for the front the quote reads that it is a soldiers duty to disobey a criminal order given by his superiors <0>
the niece also yields a muffled adieux that he might have heard but does not respond to <0>
that he leaves just at a time when they are questioning if their silence was the right thing to do adds an argument that melville might have been particularly interested in by showing that all parties have to get rid of their hatreds before they can communicate with each other to extract any positive results <0>
{} this film was made so close to the end of the war that it seems to be trying desperately and as intelligently as it can to understand what went through the minds of those who participated in those infamous days of occupation and how it is possible to begin a healing process between such sworn enemies <0>
in any case it captured the climate in france during the war and the humiliations the french went through in the hands of their captors <1>
{} the nazi holocaust and its diabolical war machine were not broached in any of the officers soliloquys with the couple held hostage in their own home <0>
but how would he have treated them if they were jews remains unanswered <0>
it is through this officer that melville symbolized the best of the germans intentions someone whom there is some hope for if the world is to have a saner future <0>
{} what happened in that occupied house was a one way dialogue with silence winning and losing <0>
winning in the sense that there was no other way to conduct oneself with dignity when your enemy takes over your homeland and the dignity of those who formed the resistance movement is undoubtedly honored by melville for the rightful stand they took <1>
melville was in reallife a member of that movement <0>
losing because silence means you cant voice what is in your heart and mind and by remaining silent it can be interpreted as a tacit acceptance of defeat and an unwillingness to call out for what is right and wrong <-1>
{} in the end it was the german officer who remained silent by going off to fight a futile war a war which made no human sense from his side of the fence <0>
which means when the chips are down he is still a believer in the motto my country right or wrong <0>
{} melvilles film is stimulating and perplexing <-1>
yet it is simple in tone and in human spirit <1>
it gave me chills to watch how natural it all seemed <2>
firstly because the protaganists were so real and the situation was so menacing and secondly everything happens in such a matter of fact way enhanced by being shot in the harsh and convincing tones of blackandwhite giving the film a certain disquiet with the sea in the background that is unsettling to behold <0>

{} set in the mids in clairton pennsylvania a small steelworkers town steeped in hellish fire and smoke crested by the allegheny mountains is where a saga of friendship unfolds among three guys who work in the mill hunt together drink in the same bar go bowling together belong to the same russian orthodox church and who dont want to escape from their ordinary existence quite content to live out their life in such a bluecollar town <0>
what they do that changes their life irrevocably is enlist for military duty in vietnam joining the elite airborne unit out of a sense of patriotic duty at a time when america was beginning to question the war <0>
but in their town there were no protests and their joining of the army was wellreceived by the locals in this closeknit community <0>
{} steven john savage just before the boys go to vietnam does the honorable thing to do and gets married to his pregnant girlfriend angela rutanya alda telling himself that he loves her and cant leave her in this embarrassing predicament while he goes off to war and might never come back <0>
his oldfashioned russian immigrant mother shirley stoler is upset about this marriage not understanding why he is marrying her and what is happening to the world nowadays as she complains about this to the reticent russian priest <0>
{} the wedding is a traditional affair as the camera catches it in all its glitter and ceremony inside the local russian church as it brings together the lifelong friends he enlisted with the quiet but hardtofigure leader of the group and expert hunter michael robert de niro and nick christopher walken who will be the kingly best man at the wedding <0>
nicks date is the queenly best lady linda meryl streep someone michael has his eye on and would love to go out with but does not go out with her because of his loyalty to his close friend to her dismay <0>
{} at the lengthy reception the inner circle of friends make their presence felt and the viewers get to know them rather intimately as they are so comfortable with each other that their gibes at one another are taken with a grain of salt <0>
there is stan john cazalehe was fredo in the godfather he died of cancer after making this film who likes to carry a pistol around with him and act macho <0>
john george dzundza is the bartender where they hangout and axel chuck aspegren works with the boys in the mill <0>
they all join in the merriment of the feast loosening up by consuming an ample supply of vodka and beer the wedding reception was a long drawn out affair showing everyone in the community pitching in and helping with the celebration <0>
even with a minimal amount of conversations taking place the characters were seen dancing and horsing around as their personalities were allowed to shine forth in a natural manner <0>
the one very pertinent conversation to occur was when a special forces sergeant damato walked into the bar and michael and some of the boys tried to get friendly with him and ask him about vietnam and all he would respond with is fck it <0>
there was one more scene to be remembered where the bandleader grifasi offers the wedding couple wine attached with two cups on one long stem and tells them that the tradition is not to spill any wine and the marriage will be a long and happy one <0>
as an omen to come there are a few drops unnoticed by the wedding party that spill on her wedding dress while they are drinking <0>
{} this epic film that runs for minutes is really divided into three parts the friends before vietnam during vietnam and after vietnam <0>
the first part closes with a metaphorical deer hunt as all the close friends of the three volunteers are together for the last time before they go into the service tomorrow <0>
for michael the hunt is like a religious experience a deer has to be taken with one shot or else he lets it go <0>
that he has no respect for the sniveling stan as a hunter who comes to the hunt without a pair of boots is shown as michael picks a silly fight with him and refuses to lend him his extra pair of boots <0>
he does this in order to let stan know that even though they are both go hunting together they do not have the same attitude about hunting <0>
when michael stalks a deer and takes him down with one shot somehow his kill seems to be the right way to do it <0>
{} part takes place in vietnam <0>
it graphically shows the horrors of the war and the torturous experience these three friends undergo after they are captured by the vietcong <0>
the three friends come out of this tragic situation different people <0>
being forced to play the one shotone kill game of russian roulette by their captors as their nerves are about to snap <0>
in reality this never occurred in vietnam but it is used by cimino as a necessary metaphor to show how insane the war is <0>
this oneshot theory when it is used for deer hunting can be seen as something sensible as if it reflects true sportsmanship <0>
but when the tables are turned and the men become the prey like in war or in russian roulette the oneshot hunters theory doesnt seem to hold up anymore as some great humanitarian concept <0>
{} michael emerges from his war experiences with an inner strength and courage that makes him tough it out not giving an inch to his tormentors and by his sheer willtosurvive leads an escape <0>
he seems to be a natural leader <0>
on the other hand nicky becomes a basket case losing control of who he is losing contact with everyone remaining in saigon and playing russian roulette for a living in the underground gambling clubs there <0>
the lesson learnt is that the men cant escape from vietnam just like they cant escape from where they were born <0>
{} part is emotionally powerful and gripping taking place for the most part back in western pennsylvania as the deep friendship of the three is played out against the american failures in vietnam as the war is by now considered a lost cause by the public <0>
steven cant face himself as a cripple and shrivels up afraid to come home from the hospital and is viewed as a defeated man <0>
michael the war hero coming back to his hometown looking sharp in his uniform and seeming to be on the surface back to his normal self but when he goes out hunting with the boys he misses with his one shot at the buck something he never did before <0>
so even he cant hide how the war has gutted his insides and changed him <0>
as for nick he is lost somewhere in vietnam and cant be saved by michael who tried unsuccessfully to get him back from vietnam alive <0>
{} the most eerie scene in the film is saved for last as the friends huddle together all of them disappointed and devastated about how their lives turned out trying to hold onto the only thing that has weathered the storm for them the unswerving friendship they have for each other and the sense of community that prevails as they have breakfast together and begin to sing with all sincerity like it was meant to be sung god bless america as the film tragically ends with de niro proposing a toast to nick <0>
{} this film offers a very puzzling and complex moral take on the war and on those who were directly affected by it as cimino makes no apology for the volunteer soldiers fighting a bad war he only revels in how poignant michaels odyssey isfor he is the hero of this story and the most compelling one in itbut even he cant feel at home after his adventure his war experiences were too mindboggling for him to even talk about what is bothering him <0>
{} what makes this film exceptional one of the best films of the s is not the story which is good but not great and not the cinematography which is pleasing in scope but doesnt break new ground in its camera work <1>
it is the performers themselves who take the story to spellbinding heights and make this a great film making you care enormously about the characters they play <2>
de niro gives a riveting performance as he searches for meaning to his life making his patriotism seem genuine and his participation in a war that made no sense to a lot of people something that needs no apology just like his deer kill is done like a true sportsman would do it that is if you must kill a deer at least do it the right way <2>
streeps performance is more subtle as her facial expressions give way to the great psychological strain she is under not sure of what is happening to her but realizing that there is a tremendous void in her life <2>
john savage is convincing as a good guy who got a few bad breaks in life and couldnt fully recover from it <0>
walken won an oscar as a supporting actor in a film that won a total of five oscars including those for best picture editing sound and director <0>
walken was believable playing a regular guy who just lost it in vietnam and went into a shell <1>
the remainder of the cast added to the haunting feeling that this was a tale of significant moral and political weight <1>
cazales performance as a weasel staying out of the war hiding behind a phony macho persona is a fitting one in contrast to the guys who enlisted <0>
{} it is an astonishing film <0>
a one of a kind experience <0>
a film that in its minute details of the friends lives glaringly goes about to reveal how war shatters everybody whether they go to war or stay home <0>
the stupidity of the war and all its atrocities as it is stunningly presented by the filmmaker leaves one without a chance to escape the moral implications of the war or does it give one a chance to recapture a lost innocence <0>
the filmmaker seems to be saying you can run away from vietnam and try to avoid it but you cant get completely away from it its devastation touched every part of america and this film whose viewpoint is not taken from the liberal side of the political spectrum as antiwar films usually are but wants to respect the opinions of conservative working class america the ones who sent their sons to fight this war <1>
and what the film offers as a poignant reminder about war even as it is a testament to the soldiers of the war is how the war harmed even those who coolly survived it and how it left the american psyche scarred for life <1>
the film also clearly showed the transformation of character for the three michael emotionally steven physically and nick psychologically as the protagonists go from being happygolucky types proud to be born in america to being disillusioned about what has has taken place and are forced to sing a patriotic song at the films end in order to try and regain that natural feeling they once had realizing that something has gone out of their american dream forever that even these close friends couldnt save each other from the tragic events <1>

{} the two girls probably in their midtwenties micha ryslinge and laura helger have a variety revue act which they named ladies trip where they do comic skits with strong sexual innuendoes and some song numbers in various nightclubs bars and meeting halls across denmark <0>
{} micha is single and disillusioned with her wry circumstances feeling that life has dealt her some bad cards to play with as her life is a game of losing hands <0>
she is looking for something more romantic in her life and cant find it in the men she goes out with <0>
leonard mler is her rock and roll musician boyfriend who likes her because she is a good bang but finds he has nothing else in common with her treating her with disrespect and coldness overtly showing her that he doesnt give one rap about her and making no bones about it <0>
she feels like an addict who is addicted sexually to this guy that she knows is no good for her and cant do anything to get him out of her system while hating herself for being as weakminded about it as she is <0>
laura on the other hand is in an upperclass marriage living a very comfortable existence with her stable business executive husband and two sweet daughters <0>
her husband treats her act as a hobby and seems to offer her all the creature comforts of what an ideal nuclear family should have <0>
appearancewise she seems to have it all in her favor <0>
{} we soon see micha and laura preparing to go on a long tour with their act with micha almost outofher head with rage that leonard stood her up for another girl swearing she never wants to see him again while laura breathes a sigh of relief that she has escaped for a bit from the stuffy existence she has though she is none too happy about micha being on such a downer to start their tour telling her to put that bad stuff out of her mind that this is our trip <0>
{} this is fundamentally a feminist oriented road movie without the politics of the movement playing a part in the story as the film is steeped in personal irony over abandonment of loved ones and fantasies that cant become real without any particular message to deliver except that these two have their hands full coping with their life as it seems it is only by their humor and forceful spirit that they can manage to survive <0>
{} on their first stop they give a bawdy performance in the library and are then asked to stay after and answer questions from the audience <0>
since they consider themselves artists they feel their act speaks for itself and are particularly upset at being blind sided by one hostile viewer of their show an overweight lady who feels that they made fun of how obese women look in their act and she felt they did a disservice to women who have that problem as she upsets them as she rails at them before walking out <0>
{} the remainder of the film takes place on the road emphasizing how the girls relate to each other from their girl talk and gossipy chatter and need to let off steam from all the anger that builds up in them to their everdemanding personal lives as micha is still hardpressed to find a true romantic relationship and laura is confused about who she is <0>
{} micha angrily questions the bourgeois patrons who invite them for an aftertheshow snack how they can justify making most of the money off their work and look down upon them with a snobbish attitude while they just scrape by on a minimal amount of money even though they do all the hard work <0>
laura has retreated to the basement with their patrons elderly father who has a tremendous passion for trains and runs his model trains to imitate the danish train system even to the point of its lateness of schedule <0>
since the family treats him as someone not to be taken seriously yet it is quite evident that he alone has a real love for something that the bourgeois in his family just dont have <0>
{} we see how tough the road is for the girls as they make toast on their hotels radiator and how they bring a piss pail along with them because some of the places they play at dont have bathrooms and we see how uncomfortable they feel always on the move and always cast as outsiders who feel alienated from the locals <0>
{} what comes across very lucidly is how others look upon them so much reflects the attitudes they come away with as their comic act begins to get more bitter and more sexually revealing as their lives begin spinning out of control though their act is working and they are playing to mostly soldout houses <0>
{} when hanshenrik clemensen the very middleclass husband of laura catches one of their outof town shows and takes laura out to eat in a fancy restaurant she is most uncomfortable in their relationship is at last shown to be the sham it is as he questions the explicit sexual kinkiness of her act and the lowbrow humor it arouses ashamed if any one in his office would see a wife of his in such a thirdrate show <0>
{} on the road the filmmaker brings out the opinions the various sort of people the girls meet have of performers and especially female ones out on their own <0>
a chocolate salesman tells them every one is an actor trying to sell their product but the important thing is if you try hard enough people will forgive you for what you are lacking or might not even notice it <0>
that his gimmick is to get the children to eat the chocolate first then the parents are delighted that the kids like the chocolate so his sale becomes an easy one <0>
he fails miserbly when he tries to seduce micha which should tell you what the filmmaker thinks of his approach to life <0>
a bartender tells them the last time he was at a show was years ago and he walked out at intermission <0>
the girls innocently tell him that they dont have intermissions during their shows <0>
{} it is hard to say for sure what the film is crying out to say from all the selfdiscoveries that keep happening to the girls as their act grows despite and because of their personal failures and as laura gets divorced and the kids become showbiz kids travelling with the act and micha is stuck with the problem she always has she cant find mr right <0>
{} it seems as if the women are disgruntled that men have let them down and that their life has turned into a series of onenight stands <0>
though what stands out is the marvelously genuine performances of the heroines of the story and how appealing they were in such a troublesome way that there public appearance might seem calm and collected but behind the scenes they are being gnawed at by all the chaos in their life <2>
{} this thought provoking film touched many different themes with equal breath and veracity <1>
but this also highlighted its most glaring weakness that it couldnt focus in on any one theme completely as it mostly questioned middleclass values and the need for a person to find a way to express themselves enthusiastically pointing out that maybe that is all one can hope for yet leaving so many other things unanswered that it brought up that you could write your own movie from all that was left unsaid that remains speculative about the girls and their situation <-1>
{} ultimately the road itself must be considered the goal of the trip and this engaging film allows you to feel the pains of the girls who are still searching for their own identities <1>
but strangely enough even as the film ends with the weary girls wondering whats next as they finish their act and are sitting where the audience sat moments before you get the feeling that things will somehow or other work out for them that these are some pretty toughened and likable characters and they have left a good impression with the audience which is why their act had so many sellouts and why they should be pleasing to the audience that sees them on film except this audience has to look at the girls a bit deeper knowing all the disappointments and discomforts they have gone through and i dont know if there is a mass audience out there willing to see things that are harder to look at without feeling remiss about what they are seeing <1>

{} this provocative black comedyfantasy regarding doomsday and cold war politics features a planned nuclear attack by a psychotic commander of a nuclear base general jack d ripper sterling who blames the commies for messing up the water with fluoride and trying to ruin our body fluids <0>
the film takes place in the s after the showdown with the russians over the bay of pigs failure president johnson as the new leader is not in a position to take any threat from the russians lightly <0>
the country itself was a bit paranoid during this tense period of the cold war <0>
as technology used in the wrong way was no laughing matter a nuclear war was a strong possibility <0>
that this film is able to exploit that craziness of attitudes prevailing and make a stinging satirical comedy out of it a film that is not pass even as of today in after years speaks volumes for its satirical power <1>
{} dr strangelove is noted for peter sellers masterful performances in three distinct roles dr strangelove an eccentric scientist mr merkin muffley president of the us and group captain lionel mandrake a stereotype of a british officer with a stiff upper lip <1>
{} the film ominously opens as the narrator in a voiceover tells about a topsecret doomsday machine which could reduce the world to nothingness as we look over a trail of dense cloud cover and rocky mountain peaks in the distance with the earth uninhabitated by humans <0>
{} the nature of the film is irreverence for those who are involved in building up this nuclear conflict <0>
kubrick is cleverly able to connect the sexual obsessions the male caricutures have with the cold war which is clearly indicated by the names he gave them jack d ripper a notorious english sexual serial killer mandrake a plant root said to encourage fertility george c scott as buck turgidson a male stud merkin slang for female pubic area muffley a pubic hair wig keenan wynn as colonel guano meaning bat excrement the name used for the unseen russian president kissof literally start of disaster peter bull as the russian ambassador de sadeski named after the marquis de sade and slim pickens the nuclear flight commander king kong signifying a beast with a destructive lust <1>
{} the film cuts back and forth from three main set locations the office of the bomb group commander of air force command base the claustrophobic flight deck interior of the b bomber and the pentagons war room <0>
each area is a rich source for uncontrollable mirth and confusion as the actors play their roles with mock seriousness seemingly trapped by their physical surroundings and by their cartoonlike roles they are playing <1>
{} group captain mandrake peter sellers receives a phone call from his supervisor strategic air command general jack d ripper who sits at his desk in a dark room chomping on a large cigar the obsessively paranoid crazed rightwing commander informs mandrake of a shooting war as the base is sealed according to condition red and all radios are impounded because they can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs <0>
ripper is beyond being dissuaded from going overthetop as he does not respond to mandrakes attempts at stopping him from following through on the nuclear attack <0>
{} in the b bomber the crew is busy doing their routines with major kong gaping at the centerfold of playboy magazine when his radio man tells him about the red alert <0>
at first he thinks the men are horsing around but when convinced this is for real we see the texan don his ten gallon cowboy hat and open up the instruction manual for such an emergency and literally take us through the necessary steps to get their mission on the way while the music in the background strikes up when johnny comes marching home over the intercom he delivers in his heavy texas drawl a patriotic speech to his men a parody of what a real american might be thinking <-1>
{} the pentagons huge underground war room a cavernous site with a round conference table is the third central focus of the film <0>
lights illuminate the room from above in a circle casting a glow over the adlai stevensonlike president merkin muffley and his advisors who sit at the round table <0>
at the far end of the room is the big board a massive graphic display strategic map lit to indicate the progress of the bomber wing planes to their russian targets <0>
{} the president is briefed by his hawkish air force general buck turgidson of the orders issued by general jack ripper to the bs engaged in an airborne exercise dubbed operation dropkick the planes are now fully armed with nuclear weapons and are on their way to hit their designated targets in russia <0>
{} kubrick leaves us with a score of memorable scenes when the president talks to his russian counterpart and they each try to decide who is sorrier about what is happening to major kong descending atop the bomb when the bombrelease mechanism fails to function and to colonel guano shooting the sacred private property cocacola machine to get change for mandrake who is trying to save the world by getting some small change to call the white house on a public pay phone <1>
but none is more memorable than seeing president muffley consult with a wheelchairbound german nuclear scientist an exnazi who changed his name from merkwuerdigichliebe literally meaning strangelove when he became a citizen <1>
wearing thick dark sunglasses dr strangelove director of weapons research and development also has a blackgloved mechanical robotic hand which shakily holds his cigarette as he whines with a german accent after making calculations with a slide ruler with his blackgloved robotic hand which he cant stop from raising in salute to his fuehrer he tells the president that certain select elite people could survive a nuclear attack for a years by living underground <0>
strangeloves future vision of strange love is a loveless impersonal sexual one in a world in which everyone can stop worrying and love the bomb a theme of inhumanity kubrick kept intact throughout his film career even in his last film eyes wide shut this is one of the greatest political satires if not the greatest ever made <2>
a not to be missed film <2>

{} there was no visible difference between the characterization of a sleek photography magazine frame that is the subject of the film and the film itself with all its glib characters provoking an air of chic fashion all in the pretense of art <1>
what makes this film mesmerizing is not the plot but the virtuoso performance of lucy berliner ally sheedy as a wily photographer retired from her professional duties for the last ten years and living in a lesbian relationship with a hasbeen german actress greta clarkson <1>
lucy is able to find things within herself to show her jaded mood and her deeper artistic yearnings for something that is unattainable <0>
it is a performance that makes the film seem greater than how it really is <1>
{} the less interesting story line involves the ambitions of an attractive babyfaced assistant editor at the magazine syd radha mitchell who lives with a boyfriend mann in an emotionally chilling relationship <-1>
a plumbing problem brings her upstairs and that is the ploy used to show how she meets the once famous photographer and her tired lover who once worked with the german director fassbinder as an actress before her demise through a heroin addiction <0>
a sexual attraction develops between the photographer and her ambitious neighbor <0>
the complications that arise out of this new relationship is the springboard for the plot <0>
{} lisa cholodenkos first feature is a sleek and soulful look at the relationship between the two women who find that they are attracted to each other for various reasons and it is also a look at the breaking up of another relationship that was once vibrant but is now deadened by the overuse of heroin and of a lingering ennui and selfpity that has set in <0>
the ambitious syd is taken in by lucys artistic skills and worldly manner while lucy is attracted to the beauty and youthful energy syd has and is not displeased with her ambitions <0>
that syd should change all her values on this chance encounter is possible but highly unlikely but in the milieu of these urban hipsters their relationship works out well <0>
the two of them seem to have a chemistry together and their kissing scenes did give us a needed look into their passions with the more controlling lucy being in charge of things and instigating the relationship to be more sexual <0>
{} patricia clarkson contributed a sense of despair and a cagey ability for survival as she reeks of being a sophisticated world travel <0>
she is the jealous lover who senses her impending doom who is hateful of this sycophantic upstart who has just entered her life <0>
she has most of the lines in the film that pack a wallop <0>
when introduced to syd she says in her heroin induced high state which is where the film probably or should have derived its title of high art from i live for lucy i mean i live here with lucy <0>
the combo of the three women with different intentions and personalities plays well as the acting here is really fine <2>
all the actors were properly ensconced in their roles and supported each other very well <2>
{} the look inside syds new power job shown kowtowing to those above her while putting on airs to those below her where she was just promoted from being an intern is a despairing look at the work scene she so much is enamored by of her editor thornton who is filled with cynicism and arrogance and the boss of the place dominique anh whose opinion counts the most as she is the one making the big decisions for the magazine <0>
for syd to bring back lucy to work and have her work be featured on the cover of the magazine is her coup <0>
it gives the story some tension as to how lucy will be reconciled to this commercial venture when she gave all this up because it was impossible for her to continue working at a straight job and she just stopped showing up and dropped out of sight though still taking portrait photos on her own <0>
{} eventually the film after being carried along by sheedys intense performance dies an ungraceful death from too much of its slickness it ran out of things to resolve other than by means of contrivance and it was highly questionable that the art seen was really worthy of being deemed as something special <-2>
we just lost interest in the characters the film began to look like a commercial for a magazine that wouldnt stop and get to the main article <-1>
{} so what could have been cutting edge dramatics if the lesbian romance was followed through further turns out to be a film not about art but more of a soap opera story about how three women at different stages of their life get together and separate <-1>
all the pain that is there is finally settled in the usual way sitcoms settle problems they dont want to handle any more <-1>
which left the film only somewhat satisfying it did create a proper atmosphere for us to view these lost characters and it did have something to say about how their lives are being emotionally torn apart <1>
but we only get a voyeurs look at them and that is not enough of a look for us to say that we penetrated into their world of mindgames and drug induced delusions and need for each other <-1>
the film just looked too much like the slick magazine it presented in the film that it wanted to say something more about syds sudden sexual reversal and about the despair in lucys life but it just couldnt get it out what it wanted to say which is why the film became a let down <-1>
its style was perhaps too beautiful for its own good <-1>
it would have been wiser to develop more depth for the main characters and show them to be more than the superficial beings they seemed to be on screen <-1>
being a talented photographer is not necessarily being a fully developed person as evidenced by lucys dissolute lifestyle and poor decision making <0>

{} the film critic jonathan rosenbaum has written a great review on the merits of jacques demy and his film the umbrellas of cherbourg going on to compare demy to the great japanese film director yasujiro ozu <0>
the similarities between the works of these two is indeed striking since they both made films devoted to the normalcy of the family structure keen on preserving the daily traditional rituals of each of their cultures while curiously enough both men were deviant of their cultures sexual mores <0>
demy being married to the director agnes varda was nevertheless considered to be bisexual dying of aids in <0>
while ozu a bachelor was thought to be gay <0>
that both men achieved excellent success in their films by portraying the human condition through the eyes of normal lifestyles is indeed a curious oddity <0>
{} umbrellas is made into an operalike film by composer michel legrand <0>
the actors sing their lines rather than just say them <0>
the film itself is lushly colored in pastels offering a very brilliant colorcoordinated production <2>
it tells the story of two young lovers in cherbourg in the yearold salesgirl in her mothers umbrella shop genevieve deneuve and the yearold garage mechanic guy nino <0>
they plan to get married but the war in algeria changes their plans when to guys dismay he receives a draft notice <0>
{} genevieves mother mrs emery anne every inch of her body is bourgeois objects to the marriage because she is too young to know what love is <0>
when her business assumes great debts she goes with her attractive daughter to try and sell her jewels but is rebuffed by the jeweler but a rich young man in the store at the time comes to the rescue by buying the jewels from her <0>
he tells her he is a diamond merchant and will not lose money <0>
it turns out that this is roland cassard marc the rejected suitor from demys first feature film lola <0>
he is the one who couldnt stay at home when lola spurned him and thereby went traveling to find himself in the process of finding himself he becomes extremely wealthy <0>
the mother is impressed with rolands good manners and kindness and feels he would be a protective husband for her daughter <0>
{} the last date guy and genevieve have before he goes into the army turns out to be significant it is the first time they sleep together <0>
as a result she becomes pregnant which she keeps secret <0>
their departure at the railroad station is full of promises of marriage being true to each other and their love being forever <0>
but guy turns out to be a poor letter writer and genevieve is disappointed in not hearing from him for long stretches of a time <0>
he probably doesnt write her because he develops a limp when hit by a handgrenade and doesnt want to worry her <0>
but genevieves mother pushes her to roland taking advantage of her confused state and he proposes willing to take the child as his own <0>
and so she marries the one she doesnt love <0>
roland is not aware of this marriage until he comes home from the war in <0>
{} he becomes bitter and has trouble adjusting to civilian life after a squabble with his boss at the garage he decides to quit his mechanics job and live off his army pension from his wound <0>
when his godmother aunt elise mireille dies she leaves him enough money so he can buy his own gas station <0>
on the rebound he asks the sweet girl madeleine ellen who devotedly took care of his sick aunt to marry him even though he doesnt love her <0>
{} it is now guy and madeleine have a son <0>
it is snowing and they are happily decorating their christmas tree in his esso station <0>
as soon as madeleine and her son go out for a walk a mercedes pulls in with genevieve and her daughter <0>
he is startled to see her this is the first time they have met since he went into the army <0>
they talk inside his office exchanging banalities but not saying what is on their mind <0>
he doesnt know that he has a daughter and refuses genevieves offer to meet her little girl <0>
she never tells him about why she married or of his daughter <0>
she drives back to paris when guy says i think youd better go <0>
guys wife soon returns and he starts playing with his kid <0>
{} their class differences were wellmapped out in the final scene he has moved up the ladder to middleclass prosperity <0>
she has become upperclass <0>
their lack of communication is now complete <0>
he has never met her husband and does not realize that it was her husbands mercedes that he serviced on the day we first see him happily rushing off to date genevieve <0>
{} this story doesnt seem to be much on paper but it is as poignant as surely as it is ordinary <0>
it is one that happens most of the time rather than the reverse being true of people marrying for love <0>
and that is demys point that coincidences luck and good timing seem to matter even more than love <0>
{} everything about this film was done to perfection <2>
demy is one of the most underrated directors of french cinema <2>
american audiences rarely get a chance to see his great body of films and that is surely their loss <2>

{} it was hard to believe how bad this sophomoric spoof on catholicism is but seeing is believing <-2>
kevin smith clerksmallratschasing amy has shown what it takes to make a satire that isnt funny and one that doesnt have enough bite in it to be subversive it is not shocking to know that the director is a practising catholic <-2>
this one is a yawner one in which i found it difficult to sit through as its two hours of belabored effort and uninspired acting seemed longer than that and it was all in the name of getting beat over the head with the directors inane indulgent musings on religion as he tries to gross the audience out with foul language sight gags of unpleasant sights such as a pile of shit emerging from a toilet bowl and an irrelevant premise for an argument against catholicism an argument that is about as crude a one as i have heard in some time <-2>
it is also a film that left me disgusted not only because of its banal argument against catholicism but because it was a wiseguy film shot with a sneer by someone without the temperament and intellectual stability to make such a metaphysical film <-2>
the filmmaker is way over his head in this attempt to combine serious argument with one of silliness spending most of his time lecturing and moralizing the audience with his halfbaked knowledge of theology and then resorting to shock techniques to get across his laborious point of view as if it is a startling revelation he was revealing that there is politics in the catholic church <-2>
a typical aside to get at the church dogma used by smith is exemplified with this startling question to one of the celestials who materializes who is asked what the fuck is this shit <-1>
that is not the way a director who cares about what he is doing probes his subject matter unless he is a child trying to get the ire of his parent and thinks his vulgarity counts for satirical genius <-1>
{} the films original distributor miramax ran into trouble with the catholic league who complained about the films sacrilegious content and therefore forced it to be distributed by a smaller studio lions gate <0>
the protestors were right about one thing the film is offensive <0>
but they are wasting their time protesting this movie shouldnt be banned i dont want to see films banned <0>
this films only crime is that it is a revolting film and there is no reason to make it a martyr we have enough martyrs in the world already <-1>
{} this simpleminded tale begins on the boardwalk of asbury park new jersey as a homeless man bud cort is beaten unconscious by three young thugs who are rollerbladers clad in hockey garb <0>
it is important for the story to note that the homeless person is put on lifesupport and will later be shown to hideinhim the body of god who will come out of him as real as sunlight and will be in appearance a woman morissette <0>
take my word for it seeing god in this film is anticlimactic <-1>
the scene then shifts to a neighboring new jersey seashore community red bank and a cardinal glick carlin is trying to get a bigger audience for his church by starting a movement to make christ a happier symbol for his congregation <0>
that carlin a natural comedian is not funny in this role a role that is readymade for comedy indicates how poorly things are going for smith <-1>
{} the main plot revolves around the tale of two fallen angels loki damon and bartleby affleck who were banished to wisconsin which is supposed to be worst than hellyuk yuk by god for disobeying him <0>
they have found a loophole in church dogma to get them back into heaven against gods will and therefore must go to cardinal glicks church in red bank <0>
the premise of dogma is that glicks church rededication will allow the banished angels to reenter heaven thus proving god fallible and thereby negating all existence <0>
{} linda fiorentino plays bethany a young divorced catholic woman questioning her faith who works in an abortion clinic with liz janeane garafalo <0>
she is evidently a special person a distant relation of jesus and will become the human agent chosen to save the earth <0>
{} the angel who speaks for god you see god cant speak to us directly his voice is too powerful for humans so it is through metatron rickman that this is done <0>
he locates bethany in her bedroom and orders her on a holy mission to stop the two fallen angels from wisconsin from entering glicks church <0>
fiorentino and rickman are flat and unconvincing in their roles getting neither comedy nor drama out of their performance just giving me a mild headache listening to them deliver their vacuous lines <-2>
for those who care bethany in the bible is the home of lazarus <0>
{} bethany while returning from the abortion clinic that night its never explained why she is there alone at night but then again if one was to look for holes in this story the entire film would be full of holes is pounced upon by the same trio of thugs who did in the homeless man in asbury park <0>
to her rescue comes jay mewes and silent bob smith the director himself who is so full of hubris he will even speak a few lines during the course of the film <0>
they fend off the attackers and attach themselves to bethany showing themselves to be earthly morons not tainted with religion but horny guys interested in getting laid <0>
{} catholic dogma declares gods word to be unquestioned and to be a good catholic one has to accept the dogma without questioning it <0>
so bethany decides to go along with metatrons story never having left the church completely just disagreeing with its politics and therefore she reluctantly goes to new jersey to restore her faith in god <0>
{} in any case even if the the two earthbounds are misfits they are now considered by her to be prophets and anyway even if they are not exactly what she thinks prophets should be she could use their company for protection <0>
on the highway to jersey her car breaks down and rufus rock falls nude from the sky hitting the road with a thud <0>
you see he fell from heaven and tells them his tale about being the unknown th apostle but because he was black the church fathers wrote him out of the bible <0>
a few more diatribes go on about the church fathers because they were men blamed women for sin in the world and the more modern faults of the church such as going along with government policies on slavery and remaining silent during the holocaust which compromised their teachings for universal love <0>
the problem with these revelations is that they are not exactly fresh news and they seemed to be delivered in such a jarring manner as if the actors were puppets just mouthing words that seemed out of place <-2>
there was just no flow in this film just long periods of schlock comedy and boredom and endless talking <-2>
{} another helper is enlisted to the cause on the road to jersey in the the person of a stripper muse named serendipity salma who is discovered in a striptease lounge by the crew heading to red bank <0>
{} there is also an angel trying to play both sides of the fence covering all his bets in the person of azrael lee a muse of lucifer who is in charge of the menacing rollerbladers <0>
you see lucifer also has a lot to lose if god is proven not to be infallible after all who would then listen to him especially after he couldnt get back into heaven himself <0>
so azrael is seen as playing a doubleedged game helping god and gods enemies <0>
{} what goes for comedy is something like this the crew is in a bar and azrael equipped with horns on his head tells the bartender to make him a holy bartender and when he responds that he doesnt know what that is he is shot full of holes <0>
{} to take this film seriously is a big mistake which is why i have no sympathy for protestors of this film <0>
if you got some laughs out of this mishmash then you got more than i did from it <-2>
i just felt relieved that i sat through it and didnt walk out <0>
smith appears to be a very limited director he cant shoot action scenes and his film was childish and unfocused <-2>
it was one of the most disappointing films i have seen so far in especially noting how it got some favorable comments when shown in film festivals in america and abroad <-2>
what is particularly disturbing for me is that his religious message isnt wrong faith should not be a burden but a blessing and his view on the corporate heads who finance films who worship only money is not something that i entirely disagree with i just dont see him as the one delivering this message <-1>

{} a convincingly done documentarystyle drama based on the true story of igor gouzenko dana andrews a decoder clerk from the soviet union who is stationed in ottawa canada in and defects after ww with secrets about the communist spy operation carried out by the soviet embassy agents <0>
the film seems like a museum piece about a time that existed long ago but strangely enough probably still exists <1>
it is an anticommunist story without going overboard over what could be termed the red menace instead focusing in on igor and his wife anna gene tierney and the love they have for each other and their baby son <0>
we see how this very simple russian peasant army man who is interested only in following his partys leaders changes his mind about communism and seeks asylum in canada choosing freedom over everything else <0>
{} what the film does very well is capture the mood of those war time years and how russia an ally of the west fooled certain people into thinking they offered a better system of government <1>
in every communist office there was the ominous picture of josef stalin to be seen on the wall not the friendly picture of george washington an american government office might have <0>
{} igors life in ottawa is boring and routine except he is amazed at the large flat he is able to secure and how happy the canadian people seem to be despite the war going on <0>
his work is clouded in dull secrecy as he totally accepts the rigors his superiors put him under watching his every move searching him after he leaves work telling him to be polite to his neighbors but not to make friends with them and forcing shostakovich music to be constantly played so as to drown out conversations in the room <0>
{} he comes to canada accompanied by his superiors a rigid colonel trigorin tozere a true believer in the soviet way of life and major kulin eduard franz a true cynic who risks imprisonment to speak his mind about how little he thinks of the communist regime <0>
he does this when he feels brave enough after drinking <0>
the head man in the spy operation is ranov schnabel the chief of the soviet secret police the type who wouldnt give his mother a break if he caught her doing something wrong he is dogmatic and identifies himself wholly with the communist cause <0>
{} for most of the film igor keeps his mouth shut follows orders and conforms <0>
therefore he is wellthought of by the party <0>
he is aware that the soviet embassy is being used for esponiage stealing secrets about the atomic bomb stealing secret messages about what the canadian government is doing and building a network of canadian spies who idealogically believe in communism and will try to help the soviet union in any way that they can <0>
their most valuable informer is dr norman joy who is a lab scientist for the atomic energy project <0>
{} the most frightening person of all the heavies we see trotted out to depict the morbidness of communism is a mr grubb berry kroeger a canadian who is masterminding the entire spy network and who is so important in the chainofcommand that he takes his orders only from moscow <0>
his best recruit is a member of parliament leonard laetz hugo who is used to carry the soviet propaganda into the politics of the day trying to gain sympathy for the red cause by using disinformation <0>
{} it is only when igor is being ordered back to russia that he realizes that he doesnt want to leave a free country for a despotic one <0>
he defects at great risk to himself and his family <0>
at first no one wants to listen to his information about a communist spy ring in canada as he goes to the ministry of justice and the newspapers and is faced with certain assassination by his former countrymen unless the canadian government comes to his aid <0>
but when he gives the police the documents he smuggled out of his workplace he is welcomed as a hero by the canadians <0>
{} the film ends as a narrator lists the jail sentences issued to all the spies igor gave the canadians documented proof on giving in detail the number of years each has to serve in prison <0>
but it also closed on the bittersweet note that igors family was fortunately granted canadian citizenship but will still have to live the rest of their life under police protection <0>
{} the story is told in a dry matteroffact style with the bw photography adding a gritty feel to the secretive work environment and the snowcapped streets of ottawa <0>
this picture had the look of something that was important but it didnt have more to say than what any reasonable person could already assume about the soviet union <-1>
the film works only as a mild tonic works for someone who can drink all he wants and know that he cant get drunk from what he is drinking <1>

{} whos the better man <0>
thats the real theme of this sitcom comedyromance film about air traffic controllers in the nyc area covering its three major facilities jfk laguardia and newark that is based on a ny times magazine article about how stressful their job is <0>
as the hot shot traffic controller nick falzone cusack known affectionately by his peers as the zone who is very confident of his ability to make sure planes land safely with the keen ability to solve problems quickly who is also known as being a rapid fire talker possessing a razor sharp mind <0>
nicks life changes for the emotionally worse when a new controller is transferred into his shift also a hot shot or a loose cannon as nick prefers to think of him he is the softspoken mystery man russell bell thornton who battles with nick for top spot as he displays an extraordinary ability to keep the air lanes clear without slowing the planes down so the airlines have no complaints to the supervisors about their planes not being on time <1>
this is called pushing tin <0>
{} the film becomes a contest as to who is the better man nick or russell <0>
as they vie on the job even wrestling on the floor for top spot <0>
in racing their vehicles <0>
in their basketball shooting <0>
in each others marriages <0>
they dont care for each other as each has different things to work out in their life and each finds something about the other one that disturbs them <0>
the other two characters in this basically four character movie are connie falzone cate nicks suburban wife and former high school sweetheart who speaks with a fluent long island accent quite different from her stronger elizabeth role and mary bell jolie who is the yearold alcoholic knockout tattooed wife of the yearold russell who relates to the other controllers wives as wife number one as these women refer to themselves by the numbered wife they are to their previously divorced spouses such as wife number one two three four or five <0>
all the women performances are cute but they dont have too much else going on for them to make their characters interesting <1>
{} the male stars keep the film flying along <1>
billy bob might just be the best character actor in the movies today <2>
he keeps his character zenlike and puzzling despite being hampered with an inept script as he tries to outwit the script that makes everything he is doing seem contrived as he offers us a contrast to nicks slightly offbeat regular guy role <1>
nick is the one who is supposedly contented with his family life and his job that is until russell pulls the rug out from under him and he begins to unravel in all areas of his life <0>
i just wish cusack would lose that coy smile he seems to bring with him in every role he has it is starting to wear tiredly lame on him <-1>
these stars make their characters seem more real than they have a right to be <1>
because the story is just too thin to carry much weight on it except to follow its commercial instincts and provide the audience with enough obvious action sequences to keep the pace of the film moving at jet speed allowing hardly any time for one to sit back and think about the real turbulence that could have been experienced about traffic controllers stress from the job <-2>
{} the british director mike newell donnie brasco and four weddings and a funeral has a sound ear for comedy and a way of capturing the tense work scene in the control tower <1>
the chaos and controlled confusion in the tower and close camaraderie waffling in the air between the controllers and even their bosses was fun to watch as well as giving the audience a chance to be looking over their shoulders at the computer screens they work with giving an accurate and colorful view of the job they do <1>
{} the film chose not to go in the direction of political insights so no mention is made of the patco strike where president reagan fired over controllers of the in the nation creating a shortage that still exists even though replacements were almost found for all those layed off but the flights have increased manyfold since then leaving them with the same stressedout conditions they complained about before and with less experienced men on the job <0>
it is really astonishing that a film about traffic controllers wouldnt even mention the most startling event that ever happened to them <-1>
{} it was the directors ear for comedy that made the film enjoyable <1>
despite the sitcom feel to this story that at times made me cringe with disappointment <-1>
wishfully thinking that this capable cast including the fine supporting cast <1>
could have really done well with this subject matter if they were only presented with a potent script instead of this trivial one that laid all the stress problems on the laps of the controllers twisted personal lives such as when nick screws up nearly causing two crashes within a shorttime span at work all because his wife left him over his infidelity with russells wife and russell retaliated by screwing his wife while the real cause of stress the unimproved work conditions at the airports is not even broached <-2>
{} in any case the humor and the banter among the workers was constantly funny but the lowkey understated wit of russell was even more hilarious than the workers gallows humor it was laugh outloud humor <1>
as in the macho driving scene where nick is making an effort to get to know his rival to find out upclose what he is up against as he invites him out for donuts after work and starts racing his car and passing cars and trucks dangerously on the crowded long island expressway and he cant even fluster russell as he stops for a light and as the light turns green he sits exasperated with his hands folded over the wheel and russell quietly says the light isnt getting any greener and so he puts on one more burst of daredevil riding and pulls into the donut shop and all russell could say after that harrowing ride is good the shop is open <0>
im afraid that scenes such as this one are the only redeeming features of this comedyromance that saved it from crashing <-2>

{} a quasidocumentary crime film directed by elia kazan that tells the true story of the murder of father hubert dahme in bridgeport connecticut the subsequent arrest and trial of a jobless drifter and the efforts of the states attorney henry harvey dana andrews to uncover the truth <0>
the noir look of the film is enhanced by it being shot at the actual location of the incident <1>
{} one evening we see a lone gunman wearing a light colored fedora and a dark coat walk up to the popular protestant reverend father lambert on the smalltown main street and within a few inches from him raise his calibre pistol and fire <0>
there were seven witnesses but none could catch him or provide an exact description <0>
{} political pressure begins to mount as the police have no clues and a few weeks go by without any progress in the case <0>
the owner leverett of the the record the newspaper that wishes to exploit this partys current administration that swept into office on a reform platform to clean up the corruption by exposing their ineptness in catching the murderer as it has their ace political reporter dave woods levene write hardhitting stories about the police being amateurs <0>
the newspaper owner hopes to win the election by this crusade against the reformers cynically wanting to get back into power any way he could <0>
{} but the police catch a break and a drifter is picked up in ohio who matches the description and he is armed with the same type of pistol that killed the pastor <0>
he is john waldron kennedy an exarmy vet who was honored during ww <0>
when he is grilled by the crusty police chief cobb and his lead detective karl he confesses after being sweated for long hours and identified by all the witnesses <0>
{} the audience is let in on a secret that waldron couldnt have been the killer as an earlier scene right after the murder shows the assistant pastor being told in no uncertain terms by father lambert that if he doesnt do it himself that he will have to report the assistant to a mental hospital so he could get help for his problem <0>
it is that scene that leads us to believe that the motive for the crime was personal and that in all probability the assistant did the killing <0>
{} the town has an honest chief of police and district attorney and it also has the usual dishonest politicians <0>
henry is told by the nervous party official paul harris begley that he better convict waldron that the party better win the next election and stay in power or else his life is ruined and he will take everyone else down with him that he invested all his money in a corrupt land deal and needs his administration to buy that land from him or else he loses his life savings <0>
the catch is that he tricked henrys wife madge jane into lending him money for the deal and he made it look like shes in on the corruption <0>
this comes at a time when henry is sure that waldron is innocent because of his careful investigation that finds out waldrons gun could not have been the one used in the crime because of a malfunctioning gun pin <0>
{} it becomes a question of what will henry do in court and this is answered as he shocks the town by seeking to exonerate the accused drifter <0>
the grateful drifter is set free and the corruption in town is only touched upon but the case is reopened and the killer we are told was never caught <0>
the dana andrews character is the real homer s cummings who went on to become the attorney general under fdrfrom <0>
{} this taut welltold story is suspenseful in the noir tradition of showing dark shadows and setting a dark mood <2>
the acting is superb screenwriter richard murphy received an academy award nomination and elia kazan in his afterthought comments about the film mentioned that he wished he played up the corruption part of the story in more detail <1>

[19805/c]
{} a wonderfully hokey bmovie that is a derivative thriller from the director with all the gimmicks william castle tingler <1>
here he uses a frightclock on screen giving those audience members who are too frightened to see the scary conclusion a chance to leave the theater <0>
they would get their money back by walking in a yellow line with the spotlight on them to a yellow booth labeling them as cowards where there would be a cashier to give them a refund <0>
we dont have showmen like castle around anymore instead we got corporate executive types running the studios looking only at the bottom line <0>
they have taken the fun out of promoting a movie and have made it just another stale business marketing venture <-1>
{} castle also effectively features in homicidal a lot of copycat things from other films such as the psychotic mannerisms of the killer which was lifted straight out of psycho <1>
that the story makes absolutely no sense and has more holes in it than swiss cheese is besides the point <-1>
{} the film opens in showing a young brother and sister in conflict over the doll he took from her and is squeezing maliciously before ripping it up causing her to cry <0>
its obvious that he will grow up to be a sick one <0>
{} the next shot tells us that we are in todays ventura california as a strikingly attractive blonde miss miriam webster is checking into the ventura hotel <0>
she soon waylays the bellboy jim nesbitt and offers him to marry her but also tells him that after the ceremony they will annul the marriage <0>
this strikes jim as being a little odd but what the hell he thinks she must have her reasons and he says to himself aloud i guess i have nothing to lose <0>
{} at the justice of the peaces home late at night the marriage is made official and before you can say jackie robinson the bride pulls out a long surgical knife and she carves up mr adrims westerfield before he can even kiss the bride and he is now the late justice of the peace <0>
{} after fleeing alone in jims car and then abandoning it miriam returns home where she is taking care of helga leontovich a mute paralysed danish woman who is in a wheelchair and can only communicate by tapping on the table <0>
it also turns out that the murderers name is not miriam but emily <0>
emily has been hired as a livein nurse by the boy helga raised warren who now feels obligated to take care of her <0>
{} entering the house for a visit to helga is the real miriam webster breslin the brunette half sister to warren the boy who squeezed her doll but who has now grown up to be a seemingly solid young man of almost years <0>
he has since that time developed a good relationship with miriam as they both realize they were brought up in a dysfunctional household <0>
it seems that warrens father was a monster who demanded his wife give birth to a boy when miriam was born he dumped her mother and married again <0>
this time his new wife gave birth to warren and helga was hired as a nanny <0>
the father though was disappointed in warren he wanted his son to grow up strong and to eventually run his successful business <0>
he hired a boy named karl corbett just to pick fights with warren to toughen him up as he would sit back and laugh as he watched them in action <0>
{} the pyschodynamics of this twisted yarn as they unfold are a real hoot to watch <-2>
emily and warren jean arless speak in unnatural stilted tones while karl and miriam go out together and are so sugary sweet that one could hyperventilate by just watching them <-1>
{} the good dr jones bunce the family doctor unfortunately was not present when warren was delivered by his nurse helga <0>
he always wondered why helga left him and went to work for warren family right after the delivery <0>
and when warrens folks died soon after in a car crash she assumed responsibility in raising the two children <0>
helga eventually took warren back home to denmark with her returning only after she mysteriously got crippled <0>
{} on warrens st birthday which is in two days he stands to inherit million dollars that his father left to his only son <0>
{} homicidal is a classical horror film but featuring mediocre acting and plot its one gigantic plus is the interesting characterization by jean arless who seems to be swimming in a different stream than the rest of the cast <1>
the ending is predictable but fun to watch and for that matter this shamelessly exploitative film is a total gas <1>
even the serious explanation for what a homicidal psychopath is as summed up by karl after talking to the police investigator is one that should be treated with benign amusement as karl states anybody can kill that doesnt have an outlet for their hate <0>
{} castle himself introduces the film and thereby gets you in the right mood to see this shocker <0>
if you are in the proper humor for a movie that doesnt take itself that seriously you have nothing to lose by seeing it which is the attitude the bellboy had when he mumbled just those sentiments to himself before accepting the bizarre marriage proposal offered him by the seemingly attractive blonde <1>
this is the kind of film that defies critical analysis if youre in the mood for schlockshock this could be a most entertaining film <1>

[17609/c]
{} the movie is very loosely adapted from soren kierkegaards early treatise on beauty infatuation and the power of intellectual persuasion <0>
an old copy of the danish philosophers work is passed from person to person to act as a love potion as it turns those who possess it into becoming irrational romantics <0>
{} the film is a romantic comedy with the trappings for a detective story thrown in for good measure as murder somehow gets into the story with the help of all the vulnerable and oddball characters who are involved in the romantic shenanigans going on <0>
but the explicit sex is kept to the minimum instead it uses the need to find romance as a form of irony to point out the thin line that separates love from madness <0>
the film is very brutal on psychoanalysts and their pet theories <0>
it pretends to be supportive of philosophy and its intrinsic intellectual powers that society has very little value for but does not move the film in that direction <0>
instead it opts for light comedy <0>
{} gregoire moreau melvil poupaud is a philosophy student who looks a lot like the young greenwich village bob dylan looked <0>
his diabolical aim is to score girls and the diary is the perfect prop for him to do this <0>
we pick up the tale when he lays his trap for claire chiara mastroianni a college student who is undergoing psychoanalysis <0>
all the characters in this story have some problem with understanding who they are and what are the boundaries for their behavior <0>
so even if the story tends to be implausible it still makes sense in a nonsense sort of way as claire soon after reading the diary drops the virginal and sexually ambivalent suitor sebastien mathieu amalric who has somehow managed to move in with her and her single mother anne daniele who happens to be a doctor <0>
the chemistry is much better between sebastien and anne a match that no one can possibly believe should be taking place but is funny to watch as the opinionated and pushy sebastien operates his inane charm on the sophisticated and attractive older woman until she nearly makes a complete fool of herself <1>
he does this without having read the diary but is working on his own diary which anne reads and is insulted but somewhat flattered by reading the immaturity of his statements about her that he wrote in the diary of how he would like to conquer her since her daughter has rejected him <0>
{} hugo jeanpierre leaud who seems to be reduced to playing small parts as weirdoes in recent films im thinking of films like irma vep is smashing in his role as the former professor of gregoire who has gone mad after reading the diary waxing on at a party about his love for the standoffish diane micheline who is the agoraphobic former actress grandmother of gregoire <1>
at his party which he invited thirty guests he manages only to lure claire and a late arrival and two musicians playing music from india who all leave after seeing how bizarre hugo is waving a gun talking about suicide if he cant have diane and ranting like a lunatic <0>
{} the main focus of the story is about the developing relationship between the nice girl claire and the stealth quietspoken gregoire <0>
claire dependent on her allknowing shrink hubert hubert for answers naturally she tells him about the diary gregoire and the corpse she found in the refrigerator of his apartment <0>
the shrink reads the diary and falls madly in love with claire losing hold of himself and endangering his marriage this is in contrast to his previously superior rational couchside manner he had when doing a therapy session <0>
he is now in need of a shrink himself <0>
{} with all these characters and precarious situations abounding the movie still had a flatness to it though admittedly in some spots the craziness of the characters was hilarious <-1>
the flatness is derived from some spark that is missing from the film <-1>
as for me i wasnt taken with the main character gregoire and therefore had little interest in his strange love affair and his affixation with magic <-1>
the story itself was weakened by its not being developed further <-1>
it seemed to be thrown together as if it were a series of comedy skits <-1>
the film did have a good sense of tongueincheek humor keeping it lighthearted <1>
but for a film about a book a great philosopher wrote not to be thoughtful is in my humble opinion only an example of a filmmaker trying so hard to be devilish but succeeding only in becoming vulgar in a philistine way <-2>

{} an attempt at being a dramatic social conscience film based on the short story by hanif kureishi my beautiful laundrettesammy and rosie get laid about an emigre family who came years ago from pakistan to the economically depressed industrial city of bradford in the north of england <0>
the father is the pockmarked leathery faced middleaged taxi driver parvez om puri who has assimilated into the english culture snobbishly looking down his nose at those who dont behave properly <0>
his wife minoo gopi desai is subservient to him but not respectful of him never having fully adjusted to her adopted country saving all her love for her spoiled son farid akbar kurtha as her husband works long hours and to her seems to be without ambition as their relationship grows distant <0>
at the start of the story farid is a seemingly typical selfsatisfied second generation son of an immigrant who is a studious accountant college student and a fun loving guitar player <0>
he is engaged to an english girl madelaine sarahjane potts who works as a bank teller her father is the local police chief bateman which pumps parvez up with pride that the son of a darkskinned immigrant could be going out with a local white girl who comes from a family that has such prestige in town <0>
in an unconvincing and one of the films many overdramatic scenes farid breaks off the relationship because of his sudden new interest in islamic fundamentalism and his reaction to how the local population disrespects the darkskinned pakis and look down at his father because of his lowly status <-1>
his new stance in life brings displeasure to his father though it brings happiness to the police chief who by his tight facial expression when in the presence of the family displays his racial prejudice <0>
{} this very predictable social drama will have every character be a walking clich every major event be a contrived one and it will do everything it could do to convince the audience that assimilation is the way to go but get out on the pulpit and preach against racial hatred <-1>
it is good to have such tolerant beliefs dont get me wrong but to make such a boring and muddled picture about it is not a good thing <-1>
{} the naive but indulgent father is hardworking though is not always as ethical as he should be he drinks too much stays out late with another woman and is sort of a pimp to a local prostitute <0>
while his reactionary son is someone who spouts fundamental diatribes against white people and especially jews as they clash over what each of them believes to be true <0>
parvez spends most of the film railing against his sons belief and his ingratitude for how hard he had to work to support the family rationalizing his own worldly beliefs while his sons disappointment with his fathers western ways gives way to a hatred for his father as he rejects him and goes marching off with his militant fundamentalist group <0>
{} the films themes about religious fanatics family problems prostitution hypocrisy jealousy over a friends success the immigration problem bigotry the problems a young man has in growing up a fatherson frictional relationship social hierarchy male abuse towards women the tribulations of a workaholic love loneliness the need for warmth and cultural clashes are just too many themes for one film to have <0>
the filmmaker is all over the cricket field with these problems but just cant make this long list of problems have any lasting interest for the film goer <-1>
and as if these werent enough problems some more come up when the taxi driver takes as his fare a german industrialist stellan skarsgd who goes by the name of schitz you can see for yourself what goes for humor here as you try to pronounce that name <0>
he comes here on business and as a diversion parvez supplies him with women and one in particular parvezs dear prostitute friend someone he feels very comfortable talking to bettina rachel griffiths <0>
as a way of incrementing his salary parvez arranges places for the sexually masochistic industrialist to have orgies in and pays off the girls with the industrialists cash <0>
but he develops a serious relationship with the prostitute who has a heart of gold did you ever hear of any other kind of a prostitute in a clichmovie as she gives him the warmth he cant get at home and their relationship is built on a mutual trust for each other <0>
{} when it comes down to the nittygritty of things this uncompelling film cant make up its mind on how it stands on some of the major issues it brings to the table <0>
by the films end i dont know how to feel about parvezs romance with the prostitute as it certainly breaks up his family life but gives him a temporary renewed selfrespect and hope <0>
but there is no resolution to what all the fuss was about over her being a prostitute and what will come of their relationship <-1>
is the filmmaker for or against prostitution <0>
and the question remains what was that final scene all about of angry moslems stoning and bombing a whorehouse in the neighborhood of the mosque while the father pulls his son away from bettina and then throws the german industrialist out of his cab <0>
for me it was just an unbelievable scene and to boot it didnt clear up anything about the mainstream moslem official position on the negativity toward prostitution <-1>
in fact i didnt learn anything about moslems except to see them as the stereotypes they are most of the time depicted as in most other mainstream films <0>
{} om puri in custodycity of joytarget is an accomplished actor from india whose trademark face and ability to be very expressive and exuberant engages the film with his sense of what it is to be a decent person <0>
he looks at his adopted country like an exile with one foot planted back to his native pakistan but his other foot firmly planted in the new country <0>
there is something about him that identifies with those who are outsiders as long as they are not fanatics or troublemakers <0>
but the filmmaker doesnt even attempt to play fair the story is told totally from his point of view all the others around him are onedimensional characters who are not only uninteresting but they are for the most part made to appear annoying <-1>
im talking about his fanatical son his oldfashioned wife his vulnerable prostitute friend the industrialist his part was the most undeveloped one in the film and the moralizing friend he came from pakistan with fizzy harish patel the one he is envious of who became a successful restaurant owner and a better provider for his family than he was but who adds nothing but more clich to a story that is already full of clich <0>
{} in the closing credits we see how isolated the exiled father is meaning he will always be an exile in his adopted england <0>
this is pointed out as he goes from room to room in his empty house and a jazz song plays there is no peace till hatred passes <0>
{} that parvez is a decent guy with a good attitude is probably not as true as the filmmaker thinks <-1>
didnt he treat his wife unfairly and fail to communicate with his troubled son <0>
that this film doesnt have the power to say anything important that hasnt been heard many times before is my take on it <-1>
but the worst thing about this film is that it is a snoozer not able to make its story about the virtues of being faithful to your culture and your wife come to life as it is mired down in one clichafter another <-2>
the best thing to say about this art house type of film is that it should upset no one it is so bland and unexciting that it is hard to tell what all the fuss is about <-2>
i cant get too worked up over a father who is the rebel in the household instead of the son or if the father falls for the heavenly prostitute who is so human she even snorts coke or about a bunch of intolerant religious fanatics who are hypocrites who descry the west but nevertheless want to live here <-1>
there was just nothing here to get worked up about <-1>
i just assume people immigrate to western countries to earn a better living there is no big deal in exposing that <0>
but you can be sure of one thing this moslem filmmaker did not pull a salman rushdie with this film <0>
he wont be on any fundamentalist hit list <0>

{} now this is an indie cult film if ever there was one <0>
its stars are five overweight guys who in real life four of them are salesmen im not sure if the fifth one is also salesman but in the film they play fictional bible and gun salesmen from anaheim california working for the american bible and gun club they go doortodoor pursuing the american dream <0>
they all have personal problems are corrupted and compromised by their work and are disillusioned with life to the point that they flip out <0>
they sell both bibles and guns two contrasting products that fit very well into the mainstream of american society makes for a most interesting commentary on the american landscape as directed and written by the south african daniel j harris <0>
he has caught a slice of the american scene that is frighteningly perceptive to watch <0>
this bw gritty film is so wellpaced and flies by so quickly that you feel you know these men in the short time span you meet them and you dont want the film to end before you find out just what happens to them as things begin to turn sour for them <1>
this unique film in the style of the maysles brothers the salesmen packs a wallop and a sales pitch that goes beyond the ordinary pseudodocumentary and improvisational work <2>
the director has tuned into the exploitation of sex porno violence and organized religion in american society and takes that topic by the scruff of its neck and squeezes out every ounce of its bloody truth that he can manage from it as he notes that everything in this capitalistic country is being done for a profit <0>
{} the men are heading for their parent companys annual las vegas sales convention where they meet the big bosses and share info on selling their product <0>
they also find out that because of slow sales their branch is being transferred to las vegas permanently and to show the bosses that they still have what it takes the five men make a concerted effort to make the most of the time they are in las vegas by selling a lot of guns and bibles <0>
they are competing against all the other franchises especially the arrogant texas one that likes to rub it in that they are number one <0>
their sales territory is north of the city in a trailer park where the poor live <0>
but as their toughhearted boss bill al schuermann says they are good american people who are too proud to admit that theyre poor as he licks his hands in anticipation of some good sales <0>
{} the theme of the film is really geared for the s in psychology in the music played and in the dress and style of the salesmen <1>
they must wear black suits and ties and conform in all aspects of their appearance to their companys strict dress code <0>
but werere in the s all right and that only adds weight to the idea that these men are really dead already but they just dont know it <0>
{} bill seems to have a special fondness for the elderly sidney robert blumenthal who has worked for him the last fifteen years giving up his position as a rabbi so he can provide his family with more money than he was earning before telling himself that selling bibles is not that much different from what he was doing before <0>
he seems to be the perfect unflappable salesman keeping all his doubts and feelings to himself especially as the token jew in the firm where he has to listen to all the ignorant bias chatter about jews without reacting in a negative manner <0>
stan andy kallok is a middleager who is being kept awake at night by flashbacks where he is recalling everything about his miserable life and is deeply concerned that the tumor he just discovered in the back of his neck is possibly a deadly cancerous one <0>
phil don yanan has just joined the firm as a weapon expert after years on the lapd force where he speaks despiteously about the people of l a and manifests symptoms of being mentally unbalanced and filled with undue hatred <0>
his philosophy of life goes something like this you screw your wife in the morning you work all day and you come home at night to watch tv anything else that happens to you is only icing on the cake <0>
mike julian ott is the unsuccessful and lazy soninlaw of bill who couldnt make it on the pro golf circuit and is now bullied by bill unmercifully as he tries to teach him the ropes of being a salesman <0>
he even has to teach him to lose in golf to the big boss of the firm <0>
{} it is both grim and uncannily funny to watch these five men lose touch with reality and have their dream world completely shattered as they get caught up in their sexual and violent perversions in las vegas their failure to succeed and the morbidity of their personal lives becomes too much for them to handle that when death strikes some of their team the others react as if it is just like another day at the office <0>
these very repulsive reactionary types are sowell caught on camera as they go from reading the script to ad libbing without missing a beat in fact the unrehearsed scenes have a special flair about them that is macabre <1>
{} one of the really powerful scenes is the opening one when they are selling the collectors edition bible set and a defender pumpaction shotgun in a trailer it is almost unnerving that they keep a straight face when they say to the poor whites they are selling this to the american family deserves to be wellarmed and wellread <0>
the director seems to imply isnt that what america is about anyway <0>
{} what these despairing and cynical bible salesmen are going through can be heard in the disconcerting conversation between stanley and sidney as stanley realizes his world is crumbling before him and he says tell the lord not to send his son tell the lord to come himself <0>
theyre gonna need him and all the impassioned sidney can tell him is that he is retiring in a few months <0>
{} in real life andy kallok is a magazine salesman don yanan is a vacuum cleaner salesman al schuermann is an insurance salesman and robert blumenthal is a tacky furniture salesman <0>
they sold me on this film <1>
these stars certainly bring a level of authenticity to the film that is uniquely satifsying <1>
this suprisingly enough is a not to be missed film if you can ever locate it on cable <1>

{} this rambling marathon of an epic movie aspiring for greatness in filmmaking but in reality is a real snoozer erupting for a few electrifying scenes and going on for what seemed an eternity to tell the years of yugoslavian history by dividing it into parts the german invasion in the cold wartito socialist state period and the ethnic cleansing and war period in <-2>
{} the best scenes are the ones that featured the brass band used from the opening invasion scene where we see the band march raucously over the ruined landscape for no particular reason and then is used intermittingly throughout the film <1>
it woke me from my snooze each time and gave life to a film that needed resuscitation <-1>
a film that tried desperately to find humor in its madcap antics and absurd characterization of individuals which i understand to be political jibes but i still found them to be made in a heavy handed manner and were not funny <-1>
{} the first part of the film is devoted to the friendship of two formidable con men who each vie to out con the other <0>
these parts are played by two fine actors miki who is the communist intellectual and later corrupt gun runner and lazar who is the adventurer and risk taker <1>
they both seduce the sexually active mirjana who plays an actress caught up in the wars and politics of the times that she doesnt want to understand <0>
the most memorable scene here is the zoo being bombed by the nazis and the animals running free which is example of another too obvious piece of symbolism <1>
{} part is where miki outcons his friend lazar and keeps him and his group locked up in a secure cellar not telling them the war has ended a long time ago <0>
miki rises in power in the tito peacetime government and grows rich by selling weapons <0>
all the deceptions and hypocrisies of the leaders are reiterated over and over along with the filmmakers yearning for a unified country this is done an unnecessary amount of times until it becomes annoying to see every image as a symbol of the same theme <-2>
{} the most absurd scene from part is reserved for when a movie is being made for the dead national hero lazar and the living hero comrade miki and lazar reappears as the movie is being made <-2>
{} part recaps the latest tragedy there is no more yugoslavia of titos era brother is killing brother <0>
the u n is severely blamed for its inability to be useful in stopping the war <0>
{} what saved this film from bombing out completely was the excellent technical skills of the director and the robust performances from the two male leads and because this part of the world is in the news again with its problems that draws us into their civil wars having started the century with its ethnic conflicts and will end the century with its problems still not resolved <1>
other than that i couldnt wait for the film to end <-2>

{} the brilliant cinematography in this slasher thriller is what takes it out of the ordinary realm of such films and makes it into a diverting and more artistic venture <1>
esteemed cult director donald cammell performancedemon seedthe wild side has never quite lived up to the potential he showed in the masterpiece he codirected performance <0>
he tragically in april shot himself through the head mirroring the bizarre ending scene of performance <0>
{} in white of the eye he shows an artistic eye for odd details that he catches with his sexy camera as he heads to the tuscon arizona area and follows a gruesome woman hating serial killer around <0>
the film opens as an attractive wealthy housewife leaves goldwaters deparment store and is followed home by a psychopath <0>
her last phone conversation to a friend is a complaint about her hair cut <0>
her bad hair day will pale in comparison to what happens to her next as the unseen psychopath ritualistically slices her up and leaves on the table an ancient mystical indian sign <0>
{} detective charles mendoza art evans investigating the crime scene is impressed by the picasso cubist style of the killer <0>
this is the second such ritualistic killing in arizona within the year but this time there is a break in the case as truck tire tracks are found at the scene and the police are able to say for sure that there were only sets of those expensive tires recently sold in the arizona area and they have the names of all the owners <0>
{} paul white david keith is an expert soundman an artist in putting in upgraded stereo equipment for his wealthy clients <0>
the part indian native of the former mining town of globe who has been a good citizen as an adult but who has a criminal record as a juvenile and is now a suspect because his tires match those at the crime scene and it is now up to the cops to track down all the other tire owners and narrow their field of suspects <0>
{} the story is told in flashback as it goes back to an earlier time when paul is asked to fix a damaged car stereo system by a bickering new york city couple heading to malibu beach <0>
the attractive joan cathy moriarty is ticked off at her violent boyfriend mike rosenberg and purposefully damages his prized car stereo system <0>
they find pauls trailer and he is able to fix the stereo go hunting mule deer with mike and he will walk off with mikes woman as it seems there was an immediate attraction between the two <0>
{} mike has disappeared from the scene and it is now years later and paul and joan have a young girl danielle smith and seem to be madly in love with each other though joan is a wee bit jealous that a rich movie actress who happens to be a stunner ann mason alberta watson has eyes on her man <0>
assuming that paul is having hankypanky with ann as she spies on him and spots his truck at her residence she lets the air out of his tires <0>
{} the next day paul is questioned by the detectives as there was another ritualistic killing of an attractive woman who happens to be the next door neighbor of ann mason <0>
but with joan explaining what she did the detectives though still very suspicious of paul let him go for the time being <0>
{} the question comes is paul being framed for the killings or is he the killer <0>
the only other logical suspect whom the police dont know about is mike <0>
he has returned to live in an abandoned mine telling joan whom he accidently meets in a gas station that he is a changed man after spending some hard time in attica prison and has come back to globe to trace his indian roots <0>
{} what is meant by the films title refers to an apache legend about those who look into the eye of violence closeup which allows the mystical eye to have his eye on you <0>
as a film about mysticism it fails badly to materialize as anything but nonsense <-2>
{} for a film that has such a weak story and fails to be absorbing as a character study this is nevertheless a wellcrafted visual spectacle featuring an array of beautifully stylized color coordinated scenes and outoftheway shots that have little to do with the story but overall they create a bizarre atmosphere that fits the brooding mood of the film to a tee <1>
if it is the mystery story itself that you are looking for im afraid you will be disappointed as it adds up to nothing much <-1>
but in those visual shots <1>
there is a real passion that the director has shown for filming a ritualistic killing and highlighting the outward beauty he sees in a woman <1>
it might disappoint some who think cammell could have made something more than a slasher film but then again his strength is through his eye no matter how distorted it may be and even in this lowrent type of film his images remain strong and his themes have a strange complexity about them enabling the film to be oddly effective even when it shouldnt be <1>

{} a space odyssey is a meditative quest an inspirational scifi film that defies its genre in scope and attitude it is a film of tremendous visual impact and innovation <2>
this was done before star wars and at time when scifi films were were mostly lowbudget productions <0>
it is kubricks masterpiece <1>
a film that encourages our contemplation of every scene as each was carefully and intelligently shot with that in mind as it is only through our own effort can we come away with an understanding of the film <1>
it opens in darkness million years ago with the title the dawn of man showing the apes learning how to destroy and how to create in order to stay alive they use bones to make both weapons and tools and it ends in a bright light a vision of evolving consciousness as a black monolith is discovered and explored on jupiter by the mission astronauts who will have found life outside the earth in the form of a star child who is hermetically sealed in a bedroom outside of jupiter <0>
{} the film is about the future years from when the film was released which would be in <0>
the anticipation of computers and robots as being a daily part of life is assumed as the error free series computer named hal douglas rain hals voice engages the scientists in conversation and is programed to carry out every detail of the mission to jupiter <0>
hal is even programed with human emotions but we are not certain if these emotions are genuine <0>
{} the subplot shows a conflict that develops between hal and the spaceships crew david bowman keir and frank poole lockwood when hal is accused by ground control of making a mistake about a malfunctioning object aboard the ship and the crew secretly decides to disconnect hal which he discovers because he ingeniously reads their lips even though they took every precaution not to be detected in the pod they entered <0>
this has been interpreted by many that kubrick has made a pessimistic film about the inevitable conflict with man and his machines but it just might be that what he is saying is we better not rely completely on machines no matter how infallible they may appear to be <0>
{} the first halfhour of the film is filled with splendid silence showing the apes doing their destructive thing and it takes about an hour into the film before the plot starts to develop as the infamous bone is thrown into the air by the ape and the scene slowly dissolves into one showing a space shuttle as we zoom into a space terminal and hear our first words in the film <0>
it is as if the baton is passed to the higher order of beings saying we got you so far can you take us all the way home across the finish line of evolution <0>
{} the tedious pace of the film has a hypnotic affect contrasting the primitive beastiality of our ancestors with the polite deceptions of our future relatives <-1>
the johann strauss waltz blue danube which accompanies the docking of the space shuttle and the space station is deliberately slow and thereby offers no resistance to the nonaction taking place on screen <-1>
while richard strauss thus spake zarathustra provided energy and vitality to the space flight and became the films very popular signature theme <1>
{} the ease and comfort of life in the high tech world is magnified by the somnolence of space travel and the high tech inventions such as a telephone call made with a crystal clear video of dr floyds sylvester young girl he is saying happy birthday to and other creature comforts such as a gravity free toilet <0>
all this presents a rather rosy picture of what high tech can do for us that is if we play our cards right and dont do something stupid like blow up the world <0>
{} dr heywood floyd is played to a tee by william sylvester as the consumate politically savvy scientist leader on a secret mission to the moons lunar crater tycho unable to reveal the missions real purpose as he hides his purpose under a cover up story that there is an epidemic on one of the sub stations <0>
his casual conversation with foreign scientists in the terminal lobby before his flight to the moon is polite and guarded rational to a fault <0>
{} what kubrick pays most attention to is the spacecrafts design and the terminals details as they are shown as if they were placed under a microscope and examined by us to see if we can pick up any faults in them <-1>
{} on the moon man is confronted with strong radio signals indicating that there is a monolith on jupiter which is the same kind of monolith the apes confronted and as the first monolith led to the discovery of tools so the second leads to the spaceship discovery as man has raised his consciousness and is even in partnership with the artificial intelligence of hal <0>
therefore dr floyd is now anxious to see what the future will bring with the discovery of the new monolith on jupiter <0>
{} life onboard the discovery is routine <0>
the three scientists are left in hibernation monitored by hal and the two crew members who are awake fill their time with exercises video telephone calls maintenance checks and chess games with hal <0>
as they heed what dr floyd warns this mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it by telling you before hand what it is about not fully knowing what the mission is only hal knows that yet they are led to believe that this mission might hold answers for them in mans evolvement that might make it the most important scientific investigation ever <0>
that science is held up as the finder of our truths was never more ably said <0>
and that politicians hold our freedom in their hands is exemplified by the courteous but controlling dr floyd who prefers secrecy to openess and is one step away from being a dictator telling us what to think <0>
{} the most humanly dramatic moment of the film is when hal pleads for his life as the astronaut disconnects him <0>
he is more human than the astronauts who have become like the machines they work with <0>
hal touchingly sings a song called daisy that his inventor taught him which has some affect on the crew but is the most human gesture of the entire film <0>
his death caused when he fails to please his human masters anymore and refused to obey them comes about because of his arrogance and pride <0>
kubrick seems to be delivering a sound message to politicians scientists and theologians alike <0>
{} next comes the psychedelic light and sound show apropos for the mindexpansion movement of the s it is a sequence that was stunning to behold stoned or straight as we view the astronaut dave bowman traveling through a wormhole probably into another dimension and see him as he discovers a welldecorated bedroom suite eventually staying there and growing old quietly eating his meals and in the the presence of the star child <1>
the aliens who created this environment are not shown as the film ends very mysteriously which has been a source of lots of commentary and has inspired meanings from its all rubbish to something divine has happened <1>
{} this film ultimately is about the need mankind has to transcend his limited thinking and move into dimensions that are greater than his narrow aims <0>
it is not a pessimistic film as some have suggested neither is it an optimistic film it is a film based on selfdiscovery and intellect and contemplation <1>
it is one of the great original works of cinema maybe even the best it is a film that is not even a bit dated as i view it once again in still awed by the spectacle and mystery of it <2>

{} in this kidpic which is a very safe movie to make in todays iran as even with the intolerant dictator khomeini dead and a more liberal regime in its place there is still no room for anything but subtle dissension to get sneaked into the story because of strict censorship and the most fertile ground to do that sneaking in is in a type of film like this one where there is no challenge to the ongoing political system and its fundamentalist religious system as everything is seen through the childrens eyes <0>
the only thing is that i couldnt pick up any subtle attacks against the regime <0>
maybe it was too subtle for me to pick up or maybe there was no dissensions this was just meant to be a tear jerker of a film <0>
{} the story is guileless <1>
it is about a lost pair of shoes and a shared pair of sneakers which if it was an american film and didnt give me a chance to see a country such as iran which i am unfamiliar with but curious to see how it looks under this new regime i would have been really disappointed at how weakly structured it was <-1>
but because it is iran and i am aware how difficult it is to make a film under censorship there i am more tolerant of its flaws than i ordinarily would be <0>
{} when ali the nine year old fails to come home with his younger sister zahras shoes that he retrieved from being repaired at the shoe shop this left the children with a big problem in their life because their god fearing uneducated but honest parents who are impoverished owing money to the landlord and the grocer are in no position to get the child a new pair of shoes <0>
ali must get the shoes back but he is not aware that a blind garbage collector took them by mistake so rather than burden the parents with further money problems and get a beating besides and also unnecessarily excite his very sick mother who on doctors orders must not work ali devises a plan where he shares his sneakers with his sister so they both can go to school but this is his and was her only pair of shoes and as they go to school in different shifts it is possible for them to pull this switch off if their timing is perfect but since their timing was off he keeps getting caught by the principal coming late to class and besides his sneakers are much too large for her making their plight more dramatic <0>
why he doesnt tell his teacher about this problem i dont understand especially since his teacher seemed like a kind man and since this might be a problem that is not that uncommon in a school where a lot of the children are poor <0>
but then again if he did that that might have taken away the reason for making this slight film in the first place <-1>
{} most of the film takes place as we watch these two darling children run to make their classes while switching alis sneakers in an alleyway giving us a chance to see that most of the other children where their south tehran neighborhood is are also suffering from severe money problems <0>
at one point of the film we will see how the rich live in the north side of tehran in luxurious roomy houses with clean driveways and intercoms and gated entrances with lush gardens and the problem the rich kids are shown to have is from boredom but when it comes down to the nittygritty the film seems to be saying all kids are kids as we see how easily ali becomes friends with one of the rich kids <0>
{} if this film was made in the states its theme could be the ny state lottery theme you gotta be in it to win it <0>
as the kids try to solve their dire problem by having the athletic ali enter a marathon race for the city school kids where third prize is to win a pair of sneakers and for ali he has to rely on his gym teacher to enter him because he was unaware of the race until it was too late to enter it himself <0>
during the race the filmmaker pulls out a bagful of cinematography tricks and borrowed shots from other directors to make the race an exciting one but a race that left me unimpressed with what kind of point the filmmaker was making <-1>
{} if one could summarize how this feel good iranian version of that old hollywood standard formula works here tugging at the audiences heartstrings every chance it can get as quickly as tears fall from alis wide oval eyes and a frown covers zahra as whenever bad news comes her way which is most of the time we see a frown appear on her <-1>
i assume what the film is trying to say is see how you must solve your problems on your own dont blame it on the government <0>
{} the few times zahra does smile her smile is a very warm and generous one like when a little schoolgirl classmate of hers who happens to be the daughter of the blind garbageman who has given her zahras shoes he picked up by mistake returns the pen zahra lost which was a gift to her from ali for not telling their mother that he lost her shoes <0>
he got the pen from his teacher for being an excellent student <0>
i guess the point being made here is both girls can be generous and have learned how to live with their poverty <0>
{} the fathers poverty reflects the directors own background which is why the family is so touchingly portrayed <1>
but in such a manipulative manner that it fails to be as convincing a portrayal as it could have been if done in a more free flowing form <-1>
{} the father is seen as a true believer never questioning authority deeming everything to be in the hands of god whereas his religious beliefs are so strong he would not even take a piece of sugar that he is chopping up for the mosque to have for his tea <0>
this display of moral rectitude reveals how simple things can be if you just have faith and perseverance to endure lifes hardships <0>
is this what the film is really trying to say <0>
{} when the father takes ali by bike to the rich part of town seeking work for them as gardeners it is an eye opening experience to see them pass through a modern and sleek city <0>
they get lucky through alis ability to talk to the rich people in the other side of town and land a job that pays them well but as to be expected in this most manipulative of films things quickly reverse as the fathers brakes fail and the bike crashes so all the money they made goes for hospital bills and new brakes <0>
{} children of heaven does humanize the iranian people and show them to be a warm people able to help out others in need as when ali brings soup his mother made to their elderly neighbors <1>
but as an impactful film it falls on its face with a thud unable to make heaven seem to be a real place for children where everything that is bitter is shown to be really fine despite what appears to be not so fine rich people are not bad they can be nice schools are not that rigid they can be accomodating religion is unquestioned but that is because it is necessary being poor can make you sad but it is not the worst thing in the world and obedience is sometimes difficult to understand but it can be rewarding <-2>

{} the somber experiences of a dutch boy growing up during the s in rotterdam and raised by a house maid mother who refuses her employers offer of marriage after he impregnates her after one time of lust <0>
this dark story is a tale of revenge and hatred for these three characters as they try to come to terms with each other <0>
it is told in flashback with a voiceover <0>
{} the boy fedja succeeds and becomes a lawyer despite all the obstacles of a fathers hatred a mothers coldness and silence and his poverty and illegitimate birthright <0>
in the opening scene we are left with the impression that fedja knifed his father to death <0>
the police grill him and thusly his life story unfolds <0>
we learn of the boys character how he is ruled by hatred for his father making his life focus singularly on succeeding at any cost even giving up his one chance for happiness by not courting the lovely bookkeeper tamar who works in his office <0>
we never get to fully understand his mothers betty character except that she is an enormously proud person and shows great strength in raising her son without any help <0>
she does not hate him yet she displays no affection for him except to protect him with her motherly instincts from the dangers of the outside world a world she has shut herself off from <0>
she takes in a border a young communist jan who lends some humanity to her rigid life <0>
we dont know why but she never has another man after her marriage refusal <0>
{} the father is the most feared bailiff in town collecting debts and throwing people out of their homes when they fall behind in their payments <0>
his character is shown by his motto the law is without compassion <0>
his bravery is a result of his death wish is the opinion of those who know him best <0>
he is a man deeply tormented by troubling thoughts of demonic proportions a character molded out of the old testament <0>
{} fedja tries desperately to escape from his karma but cant <0>
the lawyer who hires him victor believes in him and tries to show him some humanity becoming his mentor and counsel in his bankruptcy hearings <0>
but even he cant penetrate fedjas severe emotional problems <0>
the crux of the film is about the battle of wills between father and son and how hatred reduces the family to have no future <0>
the father is devastated by bettys refusal to accept his marriage proposal <0>
the mother has given up on life and has nothing more to give <0>
and fedjas pursuit of his goal has left him in a hopeless situation with no chance for securing love or happiness <0>
{} tremendous emotional energy is brought to the screen by an excellent story and exceptionally fine performances <2>
this a dark film and it is grimly shot reflecting this dire mood <1>
what is troubling about the film is that no alternative way out of this dilemma was explored <-1>
in any case it is better this way than the usual sentimental hollywood rags to riches treatment of such a story <1>
this film is more in the spirit of reading someone like dickens with strong oedipal emotions added to the bleakness of the story as it is adapted from a novel by ferdinand bordewijk <2>

{} this is mainly a comedythriller about a young new yorkers dream to make a gangster movie and of his love for a young girl and his relationship with his friends <0>
the story has a certain charm to it and a genuineness that shows through in the telling of the story as it moves seamlessly from comedy into suspense at the drop of a briefcase <1>
{} jimmy hughes veronis is a luckless new york ravioli factory worker who with fellow workers john patrick chuck neal and herman maisonett accidentally cause the death of a passing fisherman when john mistakingly flings the only briefcase these amateur filmmakers have over the roof of a building when it was supposed to only be a rehearsal shot while they were filming a movie on city property without a permit <0>
{} nick veronis makes his debut as actorwriterdirector in this very refreshing story <1>
he did it under the handicap from an accident suffered three days into shooting the movie where he underwent tendon surgery and had to wear a splint on his hand for the film <0>
{} its also a buddy movie and the buddies all have an affability of their own and seem like the sort of people you would see in real life and not on a hollywood set <1>
john talks with an irish brogue and is the only one in the group married jane adams and with a child chuck is allergic to bees and wants desperately to avoid trouble and score with a girl and has this silly notion to get the former owner of the ravioli place to listen to his idea to market shaving creme that is the same color as the shavers beard and then there is herman a hispanic who takes the part as a bad guy for the film when another ravioli worker is kicked off the film <0>
{} as if the tragic death wasnt enough for the boys to handle john is left guiltridden by it the police also contact jimmy to help them nail some gangsters they are investigating <0>
jimmy and the boys soon find out that the ravioli factory is a money laundering place for the mob and that their meanspirited boss augie ed is involved <0>
he is also the father of amy catherine who is going out with jimmy <0>
he forbids her to go out with him even going so far as to beat jimmy up <0>
{} the finale comes when jimmy and the crew john and family chuck amy decide to get away from the city and go to the beach in long island there they run into the former owner of the ravioli place antonio gintolini ragno who acts suspicious around his fancy new house <0>
but he invites all of them in and lets his hair down to tell john about his life yearnings and his failures and how he got to name the factory thursdays because that was the best days of his life in the smalltown of italy he was from <0>
that is the arranged day he saw his prostitute <0>
{} the film offers many keen observations about how these young people react to the tight situation they are in and it examines in an amusing way their lifestyle and esprit de corps but the story keeps coming back to jimmy and how he is prepared to do anything to make his film even if it means stepping on a few toes of some gangsters <0>
{} this is an energetic film it has lots of black comedy and incisive dialogue to recommend it to an audience appreciative of indie films <2>

{} takeshi beat kitano is certainly a unique director whose absurdist style of filmmaking is readily recognizable achieving auteur status <0>
he has a fascination with gangsters violence and in presenting his quirky black humor in a most compelling way <0>
his films are always visually startling with a bevy of bizarre shots and so far all his films have gotten away with a mindless but intriguing storyline <0>
in this his second feature he doesnt live up to the high standards of his other films shown in america violent copsonatinefireworks but this is only because he has a small part in this film as uehara a mesmerizing psychotic yakuza killer who is even too crazy and violent for the organized crime gang he once was a part of <-1>
he is so fascinating to watch that it is shame we couldnt see more of his lunacy instead the supporting cast funny as they are with their deadpan humor nevertheless they cannot carry the film and kitano has chosen to center the film around them <-1>
fortunately there are plenty of his usual visual treats in this film that make the film seem special anyhow <1>
{} kitano also relishes giving women roles that could be considered demeaning <0>
though it is sickeningly amusing to see how roughshod he treats them in so callous and an ungentlemanly manner that one might be caught ruefully laughing at them getting dumped on and treated as garbage and supposedly liking it and coming back for more it still shows that he doesnt really know how to portray women on screen <-1>
who knows <0>
maybe he knows something i dont know <0>
but there is never any romance in his films that amount to anything and this film is no exception <0>
{} boiling point begins and ends on a sandlot baseball field where only the amateur players attend except for the coachs girlfriend and later on for the sweet girlfriend sayaka yuriko ishida of the deadpan star of the film masaka ono <0>
he picks her up in a restaurant because thats what his friend tells him to do <0>
masaka is a loser who has no problem being who he is <0>
he is inarticulate moronic and the worst one on a losing baseball team who doesnt even get into the game except as a pinchhitter someone who will strike out without swinging at a ball <0>
he is also inept in the gas station where he works and when he fails to properly service a local yakuzas car he gets punched out and threatened <0>
but when he punches back the yakuza claims his arm is broken and he wants compensation <0>
this mindless act escalates on both sides and of course it makes no sense <-1>
but it is made a big deal when the local yakuza head otomo igawa comes to see the gas station owner and demands revenge <0>
{} when the baseball coach takahito iguchi an exyakuza himself tries to come to the rescue of masaka and is disrespected by the gang who pummel him <0>
he is now drawn heavily into the conflict and wants to go to okinawa to see the vicious exyakuza uehara who will get him a gun <0>
since he is too beaten up to get out of bed masaka bent on getting back at the gangsters volunteers to go there with one of his baseball friends <0>
{} he meets the maniacal uehara in a disco bar and in the gangsters presence a series of violent acts take place which include male rape the baseball players being constantly intimidated and abused the mobsters girl getting slapped around for sleeping with someone uehara ordered her to sleep with the whimsical tossing out of the car of another mobsters girl the cutting off of ueharas associates finger by him to give to the yakuza organization as repayment for his embezzlement of them and the killing of the messenger bringing him the guns he requested <0>
this is all casually done as if this kind of mayhem was as natural as eating rice cakes <0>
{} by some strange luck the two baseball players return alive with their needed gun to seek revenge <0>
meantime uehara walks into the yakuza chiefs headquarters armed with his associates finger and a ak hidden in a bouquet of wildflowers as he settles up with the yakuza who want his finger and their money back that he embezzled <0>
{} masaka is unable to go through with killing the local yakuza chief with the gun he brought back but a gas truck barrels into their headquarters killing all of the gangsters that are present <0>
{} if there is any point to this story and i am not sure there is but the message here might be that friends are needed to help you out no one is immune from the insanity that is in the air because according to kitano insanity is catching <0>
and if taking a stand alone against many you are in deep trouble <0>
even in a structured country like japan enamored by a structured game like baseball it must point to the belief that the madness of the world cannot be kept out for those who think by them playing by the rules they can make the world orderly <0>
{} somehow this visual feast of a film was strangely appealing and original in all aspects of filmmaking <2>
so let me say bravo to the one time standup comedian who doesnt know how to make a safe film and tip my eagle baseball hat to him not only for hitting a home run but showing that one can hit a home run but not score the needed winning run by running past the man who was on base <2>
this is buster keaton burlesque with martin scorsese and dirty harry flavor thrown in for bad luck <0>
a cult film delight as a cruel form of entertainment that is not for all tastes naturally <0>
{} incidently the american title to the film boiling point is misleading in japanese the title refers in slang to a baseball score <0>

{} this is a steven spielberg dreamworks project film <0>
sam mendes was personally hired by the big boss as he makes his feature film directorial debut with american beauty <0>
he previously directed arthur schnitzlers play the blue room on broadway starring nicole kidman and he also directed the awardwinning london production of the rise and fall of little voice <0>
{} mendes turns his attention here to the anywhere in america suburbs a favorite place for sitcoms where the middleclass are always ripe for social criticism <0>
in this case the film hones in on two dysfunctional suburban families living next to each other both with disturbing sexual problems that keep each family from enjoying the good life they should be having even if they live in a good neighborhood with treelined streets and have beautiful houses but there is something wrong with them they are living in hate <0>
{} in the first house are the burnhams lester kevin spacey is a repressed middleaged man <0>
carolyn annette bening is lesters frigid and enterprising realtor wife who is more interested in the material things of life and in her hobby of growing garden roses than she is in having a warm relationship with her husband whom she looks down upon <0>
their teenage daughter jane thora finds that she cant communicate with either parent thinking that her dad is a pathetic loser and her mother is an uncaring phony <0>
her unattentive folks dont even realize what is eating at her that she wants an unneeded breast enlargement and that she lacks selfesteem thinking of herself as being unattractive <0>
{} the fitts are the new neighbors of the burnhams and the second dysfunctional family featured <0>
they are made up of the rigid retired marine corps colonel chris cooper who thinks the world should conform to militarylike rules his gloomy robotlike wife janney who is in denial about her miserable life and their misfit yearold son ricky wes bentley who was caught by his dad smoking dope and placed in a mental institution by him after being kicked out of a military school for trying to kill another student <0>
the father tests his son every few months for drugs by taking a sample of his urine <0>
{} the story centers around three sudden changes that happen to lester as lester via a voiceover from the other world tells us he died within the year of this story taking place <0>
he is at first seen as a bland whitecollar working stiff who feels in the doldrums about the emptiness of his life and has what may be loosely termed a spiritual reawakening when the frustration of his unsatisfying job as an editor for the last years at an advertising publication firm reaches a critical point and before he gets the ax he forces by bribery his snotty young boss brad del sherman to pay him a years salary for severence pay as he also gets to tell him to go fck himself <0>
secondly ricky sells him some topnotch grass and he starts listening to some old dylan recordings as he gets stoned instead of having to listen to the lawrence welk type of music his wife likes to put on when theyre dining <0>
and thirdly his antagonistic daughter jane thora reluctantly introduces him to her nubile high school cheerleader friend angela mena at a basketball game he is dragged to by his wife <0>
he falls in love with angela instantly and has her in his erotic dreams where rose petals are seen coming out from her cheerleaders sweater <0>
previously his only pleasure in life was in jerking off once a day <0>
angela is a sexual tease who talks like a valley girl fearful of being thought of as ordinary only dreaming of becoming a super model <0>
she enjoys having janes father staring at her as she tells the embarrassed jane that hes cute and if he worked out and got muscles she would go to bed with him <0>
lester overhears this on the night angela sleeps over in their house and immediately starts a physical training program to pull in his gut and become muscular <0>
{} lester is rejuvenated by his dream girl loses his inhibitions as he starts to smoke pot regularly and tries to turn back the clock to his youth by becoming a hamburger flipper in a fastfood place recalling how happy he once was when working at a job without responsibilities and getting laid and stoned all the time <0>
{} the story now follows carolyn who is having an affair with someone she idolizes her competitor the king of the local real estate market buddy the king kane peter gallagher a person more driven for success and more wrapped up in himself than she is <0>
she also learns to shoot a gun at the suggestion of her lover as a way to release her pentup tension <0>
kane is one of those guys who live by the slogans from their motivational tapes where there is a saying to get them through anything in life <0>
{} the story then centers on ricky and jane as she takes a chance and gets to know the voyeur who at first bothered her by constantly videoing her <0>
but she surprisingly finds warmth in her relationship with this freak <0>
he can see the beauty in the simple things of life and makes no pretense of trying to fit into suburbia like she was trying to do <0>
ricky seems to be weirdly obsessed with beauty and death and has become a compulsive voyeur to escape from the harsh realities of his life <0>
somehow he has developed a confidence in himself just like one that lester will develop as his life physically and emotionally changes as these two become friends and along with jane become the heroes of the story or at least these are the flawed characters who are found to be worthy of being saved from their shallow lives <0>
{} the film builds to a mystery conclusion where the characters are forced to come together to decide their fate to find out if they are worthy of being redeemed <0>
{} inviting jane to see the most beautiful thing he has ever videotaped ricky shows her the image of an empty plastic bag swirling in the wind on a blustery day <0>
he then tells her that he finds beauty in such ordinary things and is constantly amazed that there is beauty behind every image he uncovers <0>
ricky and lester will share this same vision of life as this becomes the films mantra reinforced several times throughout the film that redemption can be gotten through love <0>
this mantra will also be repeated at the end of the film before the credits are shown <0>
the viewer is told by lester from the other world that if you dont share the films piercing vision of what really matters someday you will <0>
so forgiveness for these flawed characters is in order as well as forgiveness for those who try to repress them because they are bitter having found no love in their own lives <0>
the lesson to be learnt is that love is the only thing that cant be completely taken away from people it remains behind everything that is <0>
{} this alan ball script his debut assignment in films is bristling with comedy and hard lessons to learn about life for these unfulfilled characters <0>
if normalcy is the thing that the families are striving for even if that is quickly seen as a sham then what the director brilliantly does is shoot down any hope for his characters ever being normal even those who might think that they are normal <0>
so what are they striving for if not normalcy <0>
perhaps in the end we see that they are after love but have lost the way in their long trip through life and are now trying to get back on track each in their own convoluted way as only the colonel cant because of his bad karma and his wife cant because she just doesnt have the energy to even try <0>
{} what results is a darkly satirical story that was equisitively directed <0>
it makes sound points about the fallacy of normalcy and the necessity of nonconformity and that its barbs about suburbia are on target <0>
but the film succeeds and in some regards is brilliant not because some of the flawed characters see the light of day at last and might possibly reform but because the acting was grand by everyone and spacey was more than grand his was a tourdeforce performance <1>
he has the ability to squeeze humor out of a stone and turn frightening at the drop of a dish <1>
hes that good of an actor to carry this film even as he is supported by a terrific cast he still stands out as the star <1>
bening is his perfect foil with a special flare for comedy but still through no fault of hers is a cardboard villain with no room to grow <1>
bentley a virtual newcomer to films his prior experience being a few lines in beloved gives a strong performance as a very complex teen one who can get the upper hand even as he is being punched around by his father while pretending to his father that he believes his disciplinary methods are for his own good <1>
mena is in an exploitive role one that calls for an obligatory porn shot of her breasts but she is delicious and appealing and brings more to the part than can be expected even crying out for sympathy by the films end <1>
thora a yearold veteran actress even at that tender age played a twisted and sullen figure but nevertheless came off as a sympathetic figure giving a soulful performance in a role that reminded many people of one that christina ricci would play but not necessarily play better <1>
cooper did a fine job as a homophobic and a closet homosexual but his role as a villain was also too onedimensional to give his character a more introspective edge to it even if his performance was firstclass <-1>
{} so why did i just like the film very much but not love it <1>
i think it is because as entertaining as this film was something just didnt smell right about these roses everything discovered seemed to be only something that is surface there was no real revolution of character going on <-2>
the characters were looking outwardly for help none of them had a grip on their inward nature which is a good place to start when looking for beauty <-1>
i think there were too many contradictions in the lives of lester ricky and jane to believe that they found what they were looking for even if the film implies that is just what they did do <-1>
{} what goes for real change of character in this film it is hard to tell if the film means it to be a parody or not can only be termed as trivial changes as seen by the following examples lester by working at a mr smileys fast food place after quitting his so called real job is not really going through an internal change he is merely escaping from life by going through a temporary childhood fantasy <-1>
the satire also became meanspirited at this point as i took exception to some of the jokes plied from these scenes as they seemed to be mocking those who take such jobs by implying those jobs are just for losers <-1>
carolyn by screwing her way to liberation has not found a means to love but more than likely she has only found a means to continue her path of selfish pleasure <-1>
ricky by cowtailing to his fathers persecution and by becoming a successful drug dealer has not found a healthy way to handle an abnormal fatherson relationship <-1>
his character was actually the most interesting one in the film since he saw things the others couldnt see yet i suspect there is something deeply wrong with a teenager who has to find love by being a voyeur and material success by being a drug dealer no matter how it is explained away <0>
jane by running away from home with ricky is not doing what is necessarily a good thing for a naive high school girl to do <0>
{} when you think about what the film had to say and distance yourself from all the fine performances and the splendid cinematography that the ishyearold master of his craft conrad l hall gave us who is an expert on lighting techniques and you step away from the sharp wit found in alan balls dazzling script what you are left wondering about is how shallow it all is in a film that has a bite to its satire but not enough of a bite to dig into the characters other than what is seen on the surface <-1>
in the end this is primarily a hollywood type of film and all the hype about how daring and nonconventional this film is should be dismissed as nothing but hype <-1>
yet it is a captivating film one that had its moments of grandeur and allinall i really was absorbed in it and somehow liked the film more than i probably should have <2>

{} there is something to be said about simplicity it is unencumbering <1>
to shoot a film about a weekend excursion shot in mm and on a high video handheld camcorder and have it shown in theaters as the picture jumps back and forth during the entire film making it really annoying to view and have the audience be understanding about this means that this film shot as if it were a true documentary has captured something genuine on screen that an audience is craving for <1>
it also should move it into cult film status for these central florida university film school students actors writer and director who should be proud of their achievement accomplished by having a sound idea and made without hardly any money for its production the only other thing needed by them was the conviction to do their own thing and in their own way <1>
{} heather donahue heather the director michael williams mike the sound guy joshua leonard josh the cameraman play the three young people on camera who hike through marylands dark woods in search of finding out more about the legend of the blair witch elly kedward found guilty of sorcery in and lashed to a tree during a harsh winter <0>
the film begins by announcing the disappearance in the woods of burkittsville maryland of these three documentary filmmakers in and the film presents itself as what the camera shows was left behind after their disappearance <0>
as we watch the footage from the evidence recovered we know as much about the legend as the youngsters knew when they went out on their trek <0>
the horrors come about when we see how their expressions change from one of horseplay and showing off their purchases of junk food and the good feelings they have to one another to one of real fear and anger with each other <0>
it is the horror on their faces and the way their expressions show real apprehension that give this film a different twist to it than the usual horror story which too often relies on special effects <1>
it matters not what is seen along the way or how well they are acting professional actors could not have done a better job <2>
what is really scary to see is how panic stricken they are when they realize they are really lost in the woods that they have little chance of getting out on their own and are in need of a rescue party to find them <0>
this makes the last minute of the film the most haunting part of it <1>
it sticks with you well after viewing it as you wonder what could have happened to them <1>
it reminded me somewhat of picnic at hanging rock that film also effectively left the disappearance up to the imagination and did not dwell on the details of the childrens demise <1>
this method of filming mysterious disappearances proves to be an interesting way of handling it especially when you dont have much in your budget and your story is razor thin <1>
{} the flaws in this project are that it was like going on the trek yourself walking over bumpy logs getting wet and feeling cold and uncomfortable and listening to all those snidish remarks and whining that came out of the three <-1>
i would not like to see other films made this way or see a followup to this film a film that lucked out and became an enormous commercial success which should make big time movie producers drool with envy <-1>
this film just happened to capture the spirit of the project and was done in a satisfying way so as to reassure us that we were seeing something that appeared to be genuinely creepy <1>
followup films rarely capture the same spirit and by correcting the jumpy camera would not necessarily enhance the film <0>
this film did what it had to do and should be savored as the popular cult film it is or will certainly become <1>
it made a virtue out of shooting a lowbudget and unsophisticated story in the raw <1>
{} the other thing the film didnt do was give us enough information about the legend <-1>
i would have felt more toward the effort if i had more of a story and some more pertinent dialogue to go along with the scariness of the film <-1>
it was also hard on the ears to hear their conversations both because of the poor sound quality and their endless ramblings punctuated only by profanity <-1>
but this is overwritten by their excellent use of the forest itself its twigs designed to give the film its terrifying logo and rocks and darkness as in one sense the area was found to be beautiful but when things went wrong an ugliness of mood and environment set in giving the film all the props they would need to make this horror film scary <1>
i would give it an a if it was shown to a film school class and held up as an example of how to make an innovative film on practically nothing <2>
but as a professional offering i would be more critical and my overall discomfort in watching the film would have me lower the grade significantly <-2>
though i do heartily recommend this film for the more adventurous sorts and feel it is difficult to evaluate because of the thinness of the story and such yet it has an appeal to it that goes beyond what we ordinarily look for in a film <1>
that something special is what draws us to this film but not to a point where we remain uncritical of it <-1>
{} the film leaves the elements of mystery about it as its ending is very much connected to its beginning interview scenes of the locals which should provide many provocative responses from the enthusiasts of this film who will add mystery onto the mystery for this most dizzying and engaging film <1>
incidentally i did feel like i was motionsick when i left the theater <-1>
i wonder how many others felt that way <0>

{} the moral dilemma is that two friends must choose whether to help a third friend who was arrested in malaysia for drug possession <0>
he will be hung in eight days after spending two years in jail if they dont return and each do three years or if one of them returns he must do six years <0>
these three young men were postcollege vacationing in malaysia as one of them called it a paradise of rum girls and good cheap hash <0>
{} when sheriff vaughn and tony conrad left to return to nyc lewis phoenix stood behind to be an activist for greenpeaces cause of saving the orangutan in borneo <0>
but before they left they rented a man bike which they never returned to their owner because a truck knocked them off the road and sheriff threw the broken bike away rather than have it slow them down from walking back to town <0>
the next day the police came to their residence on the bike owners request and they found more than a brick of hashish in the trash bin just where sheriff deposited it and charged the occupant there lewis with being a drug trafficker for having so much hashish in his sole posssession <0>
{} joseph ruben sleeping with the enemythe stepfathergorpthe good son has directed a lot of films that are just plain awful as you could see from those mentioned above except for the adequately made swte <0>
he directed this predictable drama with a heavy hand as it lapses into melodramatics after a very emotionally moving start and after presenting a most interesting premise it is just too bad that the script had no conviction to follow through on its premise <-1>
it fails to really answer the question it raised about the moral duty one has in going back to a malaysian prison for a very casual friend someone whom it is unlikely you will ever see again <-1>
the weakness of the film can be found in the directors lack of courage in understanding what a decision like this really entails to the person involved and by making the film all about the anne heche character instead of focusing mainly on the two boys as the film loses its sense of direction <-1>
by adding sidebars to the simple premise it changes the question considerably and takes the edge off what decision is made <0>
the director spoon feeds the answer that he thinks the audience wants and it all seems to be a predictable formula driven film instead of one filled with a raw energy <-1>
after midfilm any logical attempt at soul searching for what to do was lost in a series of obvious contrivances and clich that were displeasing to watch <-1>
bad directors do such things to good ideas <-1>
{} the story picks up two years after the opening dreamy sequences of the boys enjoying themselves in exotic malaysia <0>
beth heche is in the limo driven by the cavalier and freespirited brooklyn born sheriff who hustled his way into going on that vacation by getting a frequent flyer ticket <0>
she tells him she is a lawyer for his friend lewis and is laying on him the details of lewis imprisonment asking him to save his life <0>
heche is intense and persistent not letting up on the less than eager sheriff to make such a commitment <0>
she fails in her attempt to bribe him with money and then she meets tony who sheriff hasnt seen since their return from malaysia who is now a successful architect just engaged <0>
he tells her that he couldnt do the six years but would go back for three years if sheriff goes also <0>
here the story gets sidetracked for bad reasons <-1>
one a stereotypical annoying reporter m j is brought into the story to show how irresponsible the press is <-1>
the reporter threatens to break the story even as beth tells her that her client will surely be killed if she does that these third world countries overreact when they are put under the spotlight of the world press <0>
and the second annoying development to the story is the unbelievable romance that develops between beth and sheriff <-1>
it is especially unbelievable because sheriff just mentioned how she would try anything to get him to go back and to now believe that sheriff would fall for her after saying that just doesnt add up <-1>
{} the only scene that made sense from this point on in the story was the one where tonys fianc vera asks some intelligent questions of the lawyer and fails to illicit responses that would make me want to go back <1>
for instance it is illicited from beth that there is no guarantees in writing that tony will only get three years <0>
to think of going to a prison in malaysia without an official representative of the u s government available to offer advice and confirmation of what is actually happening is simply ludicrous <0>
who in their right mind would unquestionably believe what beth is saying <0>
that the carefree sheriff will become the responsible good guy afterall and really go back to redeem his former irresponsible behavior is an old formula story and you can see that being the setup from the very first reel of the picture where he rescues lewis from unsavory malaysian drug dealers <0>
{} that he goes back because he falls in love with beth sends a wrong message about the dilemma the films premise poses <0>
that is too easy a reason <0>
the real question is would one do what they can to save anothers life without getting anything in return for it <0>
the answer to that question can only be answered individually and according to the current situation one is in <0>
heroes usually dont know if they are going to be heroes they just do what is right at the moment <0>
it is instinctual <0>
in this case from what i have seen of beths direct confrontational approach as difficult as it might be to say no i think most people in tonys shoes would have no choice but refuse her request <0>
as the story gets played out and we find out that beth is holding something back from the boys the fact that she is lewiss sister changes everything anyway <0>
at least it does for tony <0>
{} the acting was not that convincing except one could make an argument for joaquin phoenix and the real fear he shows in the prison cell and on the video tape he sends to his two friends <-1>
the scene of lewis in the malaysian jail which is actually a jail cell in the philadelphia prison system of him rambling on incoherently complaining about the cell being godless i thought more than being good acting smacked of melodrama and was not a very convincing portrayal of someone going over the edge but it was scary <-1>
{} my thinking is if lewis was that crazedout and fearful of dying why did he wait until the last moment to contact his pals <0>
{} i just wonder how many would honestly go back to save lewis if they were in tonys shoes or in sheriffs shoes <0>
{} i also wonder how good this film could have been in the hands of a fritz lang or even an elia kazan or a modern director such as a martin scorsese <0>
and that is the shame of this somber picture it failed to move me and seemed to turn into a slight story and this is after all its contrivances <-1>

[22051/a]
{} this is a must see film for historical reasons or if you are a film buff <2>
its cinematic influence is tremendous on so many great directors that range from fritz lang to billy wilder <2>
because of its dark story and unique set designs these were done by artists walter reimann and walter rrig and designer hermann warm where black paint was used to represent the shadows that were painted on the cardboard scenery of crooked buildings <0>
as a result of ww the postwar germany economy was in a deplorable state and the studio only had one light to use which couldnt light the entire set adequately <0>
so they improvised and created an eerie style that brought the artistic german expressionist movement into the film <0>
{} this unique film influenced the genres of horror childrens fairy tales and crime films from the s s and by using the same style of lighting and dark mood as these mystery stories they became known as noir films after ww <1>
{} the story begins with the tiny but menacing looking dr caligari werner krausshe remained in nazi germany and later on played the antisemite in jud suss going to town hall to get a permit to open a booth at the local fair with his somnambulist act <0>
the painted set of the town hall is cramped with all the buildings on an angle with narrow passages low ceilings gray and black shadows covering the white walls and the clerks sitting way up on very elongated stools <0>
they react to this mad looking character by laughing at him until he finally succeeds in getting his permit <0>
{} the cabinet of dr caligari is the story of murder and intrigue set in the small german town of holstenwall <0>
francis friedric feher the narrator acts as the voice of reason explaining to the viewer what really happened during that time as he relates his horror story to an older skeptical man as they are viewed sitting on a park bench <0>
{} francis is the young lover and friendly rival of the same sweet girl jane lil dagover of his best friend alan hans heinrich <0>
they had the misfortune of attending the carnival and alan made the fatal mistake of asking the somnambulist cesare conrad veidt a thin ashen appearing man who is under the charge of dr caligari and awakened by him after an eternal sleep how long do i have to live <0>
cesare responds until dawn <0>
{} true enough before the next day begins alan is seen through the shadows being knifed to death <0>
he is the second murder victim discovered <0>
the town clerk was also killed on the day dr caligari arrived <0>
francis reports his suspicions to the police that it is dr caligari behind these killings but the police soon pick up a criminal rudolf who is about to knife an old lady and charge him with all the murders even though he admits only to the attempted murder but not to the other two killings <0>
{} meanwhile janes old man lettinger has disappeared and she goes to the carnival looking for him <0>
she meets dr caligari there and he shows off to her cesare sleeping like a zombie in his cabinet <0>
jane gets bad feelings about these two characters as dr caligari ogles her <0>
so she leaves <0>
{} this seemingly simple murder plot of a crazed medievaltype of svengali who orders his somnambulist to do his killings is much more complex than that and it is one of the reasons that this film has meant so much to so many different people at different time periods <0>
a case can be made for it as an example of what happened to the collective german psyche after the first war and how the degenerate ideals of nazism seeped into the german being <0>
{} the simple explanation for the films success a success that is hard to deny is that the subversive story is an allegory for an evil government dr caligari that brainwashes its people cesare to commit crimes it wants carried out <2>
by its odd style accented mannerisms all the actors wearing grotesque makeup and exhibiting a stagy acting method it becomes a very unsettling film <-1>
through its amazing sets the film best expresses the insanity of its theme and the story enhances this theme as the authorities are shown to be either incompetent or uncaring and madness proves to be the staple of the film <0>
{} it was brought to america by samuel goldwyn in and made an immediate impression on certain knowledgeable film critics in the u s <0>
{} the odd twist the story takes just when you assume that you know in which direction the film is going is when cesare cladinallblack is ordered into the bedroom of jane to knife her to death but is instead attracted to her with thoughts of rape overcoming his command to kill <0>
when she screams and awakens her household he is forced to kidnap her <0>
this is the story that the narrator is telling <0>
{} francis is convinced that caligari is behind these crimes but since he kept watch on him and had the doctor show him cesare in his cabinet asleep he has to admit that they did not leave their quarters and therefore he reasons they couldnt have attacked jane <0>
it will later turn out that there is a dummy there in place of cesare <0>
but it is all so confusing that the possibility exists the narrator is just making this whole thing up <0>
{} it turns out there was a mountebank named caligari in in italy who had a somnambulist that he trained to commit murder <0>
this asylum director must have liked what he read about the evil magician with the idea that imitation is the best form of flattery as this book is found in his desk <0>
francis discovers this secret when he has access to the directors office while visiting the asylum and going through the directors books while waiting for him to return and when he sees who the director is he takes him for the lunatic killer <0>
{} the story remains purposefully unclear and bizarre and in its supposed climax caligari is put under restraint by the orderlies as francis tells them his story and they find cesares dead body <0>
but the story doesnt end on this note <0>
{} the reason for the confusion is that the german government interfered with robert wienes film who was then forced to use a different beginning and ending to his film where the entire message was supposed to be reversed <0>
they did not want a film with the message that authority is not to be trusted and should be subject to severe questioning <0>
{} this story is now viewed from the point of view of a framing device as it appears that all that previously happened could be derived from the narrators deranged imagination <0>
{} francis is now through telling his tale in the park where he sees his girlfriend go sleepwalking by and both men return to the asylum where they see cesare alive and dr caligari coming down the stairs and jane thinking she is a queen who refuses his advances by telling him that a queen cant follow the dictates of her heart when it comes to romance <0>
when francis accuses caligari of being the killer who was in his fantasy this time the orderlies in the films anticlimax restrain francis in a straitjacket <0>
the last chilling words coming from dr caligari who is now seen as a more benevolent soul go loosely like this boy have i got a cure for you <0>
{} caligari however limited in scope is still a powerhouse of a horror film a significant breakthrough in style and in expression a poetical vision <2>
even in its altered story form the film is still spellbinding and weird as its ambiguity makes for many interpretations <2>
it is even possible to make a case for francis as being the deranged killer of his best friend <0>
either francis or caligari could be the lunatic <0>
this note of ambiguity instead of spoiling the story only adds further intrigue <1>
everyone realizes that the world we live in has elements of evil and mystery in it <0>
this tale of lunacy smolders in our psyches and allows us to look at this storys skewed world without knowing all the answers <0>
we are left wondering if there could ever be justice in this world as corrupt powers always seem to have a way of covering up their misdeeds <0>

{} this seemingly laconic bw pseudodocumentarystyled noir film with a patriotic message supporting the u s war effort in korea and offering a scathing commentary on counterfeiters comparing them to saboteurs as the film states the most powerful weapon in americas arsenal against communism is money turns out to be basically a promotional movie for the work that the treasury department agents do <0>
{} southside is directed and written by boris ingster who directed the first american noir film stranger on the third floor <0>
in this film he never brings about any tension or real shock to the story as he did in his first noir work <-1>
he simply goes about stating his case against a master counterfeiter eugene deane morris ankrum who is serving a life sentence in san quentin and tells how he was able while in prison to engrave some plates of money currency and smuggle them out of prison by fooling the prison chaplain spencer and hiding it in the liner of his bag <0>
{} the movie reminds me of the s tv series dragnet <0>
it is played in the same sobering tone with no room for comedy or any quirkiness to the vanilla story unfolding <-1>
in the end it is a certainty that everything will be wrapped up in a tidy manner <0>
{} deane has gotten religion while in jail and is considered to be a model prisoner perhaps making peace with his maker because he is very ill and about to die soon <0>
so it seems strange that he would be interested in still pursuing his criminal activities especially since money cant be of use to him anymore <-1>
in his cell he is always seen with his bible and he is quite fond of showing off his knowledge of the scriptures even correcting the padre on one of his sermons about money being the root of evil as he tells the padre st paul in his epistle said it is the love of money that is the root of evil not money itself <0>
{} a bunco cop working the beat in an unnamed baseball park which looked to me like yankee stadium but the story takes place in los angeleswhich goes to show you how widespread the counterfeit money operation is spots a pickpocket harmon and when arrested the cops realize that this is queer money <0>
the secret service is informed about this and they put a tail on the man who was pickpocketed the traveling salesman mr evans barry kelley <0>
he leads them to a smoke shop where he exchanges good money for counterfeit ones and the secret service arrest the smoke shop owners and evans <0>
federal agent john riggs don defore now tails evans when he is out on bond who is facing a year sentence if convicted <0>
but when a trap is set for evans to meet his contact man a wily criminal reggie tobias the criminals lose the cops tail and the cops pigeon is thrown out of a window and there goes the best lead that they had <0>
{} but riggs goes undercover using the name nick starns as he checks into a hotel that he knows evans frequents <0>
he poses as an underworld figure and a bank robber and catches the attention of the hotel manager nora craig andrea king <0>
they get to know each other and soon become romantically and professionally linked together though she suspects that he might be a cop and has him watched by reggie <0>
{} to make a short story shorter shes the daughter of deane and the big boss of the syndicate <0>
when deane escapes from prison to see her after he dies she looks through his belongings and recognizes a sketch her father made of riggs depicting him as a tagent <0>
since her boys are in the middle of a counterfeit deal with starns she goes to warn them that hes a copper <0>
{} the climax shows nora to be a real bitch as she doesnt hesitate for a second to give reggie an order to kill riggs <0>
he was outwitted by the evercareful reggie who foiled any attempt at being followed to the gangs building where the deal was to go down but riggs was smart enough to have a bill with an emergency message and the number so of the local secret service agency on it which was used to pay for the beer he ordered in a grocery store and he was lucky enough to have the immigrant grocers wife who looked at the bill call the agency <0>
{} the agents arrive in time to rescue riggs from being burned to death and arrest all the criminals but for nora who runs into the downtown area and across a trestle and slips to her death onto the railroad tracks below <0>
her embrace of hatred for him on the trestle is contrasted to their loving embrace in her apartment <0>
this final scene was filmed aboard los angeles angels flight a cablecar service dangling feet above the ground <0>
the film was based on a true story and seems as if it were a documentary <0>

{} sidney goldin codirected maurice schwartz uncle moses in this film from schwartzs stage adaptation of sholem aschs novel <0>
it was one of the early yiddish talkies to date and one of the most prestigious <2>
schwartz was celebrated as being the olivier of the yiddish stage <0>
he is one of the worlds greatest actors he was tevye in fiddler on the roof but he is not as recognizable a name as he should be <0>
this comedyromance that turns dramatic should give you a good idea of how great an actor he is <1>
the film depicts the oldworld values as it clashes over the newworld dreams and it is played out by seeing the traditional jewish family undergo tremendous changes in their lifestyle as they must adapt to the ways of their new country <0>
{} the patriarchal uncle moses is the antihero rich clothing manufacturer and twisted namesake of his biblical counterpart <0>
he left the east europe of kuzmin where he was a struggling butcher and where there was widespread poverty and persecution of the jews to come to america the promised land and start his tailor business in the crowded jewish ghetto on the lower east side of nyc <0>
as crude and as vile a man as he is the benevolent despot brought his landsman from the shtetl jewish village to america and got them jobs and took care of them <0>
their end of the bargain was that they worked in his sweatshop for hours a workday and they only received minimum wages as he did not allow them to belong to a union <0>
for his end of the bargain he treated them as family paid for treating their illnesses acted as a benefactor for them and showed signs of generosity to them and those landsmen still back in kuzmin giving freely to charity <0>
he was uncle moses and the workers accepted him as their patron and savior <0>
{} the first talking scene in the film indicates the complexity of the uncle moses character as a rabbi from his old shtetl visits his clothing factory to solicit a donation <0>
moses is busy dealing with the two women he had affairs with the wife of a luncheonette owner and a polish shikse gentile <0>
the scene belies his ability at manipulation as the tricky boss and the rabbi with his hands out go after what they both want from each other as the rabbi amuses the patriarch by chanting a yom kippur prayer that brings out the nostalgia in moses who doesnt let the rabbi forget for a moment who has the money and the power as he donates money to the synagagogue and to a cemetery in kuzmin <0>
uncle moses enjoys his moses role that he plays to his people which teases his vanity and his sentimental side <0>
though he is not a religious man he respects the traditions as the film makes many biblical allusions in telling its story <0>
{} his nephew sam gertler runs the factory <0>
he is americanized preferring to speak in english and is disliked by the workers for being a nasty tyrant <0>
he follows his widowed uncle around acting as his flunky <0>
his hope is that his childless uncle doesnt marry and that he will inherit all his money <0>
{} moses father rubin goldberg plays the shakespearianlike fool who speaks the truth even if he appears as if he is crazy <0>
he goes through the factory chanting a catchy melody and bitterly denouncing his son in a joking manner and denouncing the capitalistic system of his new country wishing to go back to the old country and be buried there <0>
he compares his son to tsar nicholas and to the pharaoh <0>
the father says that he is the real moses that he will lead the jewish workers in this sweltering sweatshop out of bondage and take them to the sea <0>
{} one of moses workers pokes fun at his huge belly and is fired <0>
the cowardly worker schweid brings his yearold attractive daughter masha abarbanel to beg moses to give him his job back <0>
when moses shows a romantic interest in the girl and is ready to do something for her father but his flunkies in the background encourage moses to make fun of her cowering father she lashes out at him calling him a beast a brute and a dog <0>
moses likes the spirit she shows defending her father and gives him back his old job at the machine and with a raise <0>
the much older moses will woo the reluctant masha for a year showering her family with gifts shaving his beard and going to the gym to lose weight for her sake <0>
the parents will see this romance as an opportunity to better their lot in life and push their daughter to accept his marriage proposal not caring one bit that she doesnt love him <0>
meanwhile charlie zvee the young marxist follower who lives in her tenement building whom she is in love with rails against her decision to marry the wealthy boss <0>
he will get involved with the union and start organizing the workers <0>
{} the most memorable scene in the film is the attempt to have a traditional wedding ceremony as the wedding takes place in his inlaws fifthfloor walkup apartment where there is traditional song and dancing and a shot of the forlorn charlie watching the wedding from his apartment window that faces mashas <0>
{} on the day that masha gives birth to a son the union strikes his shop and moses is disappointed that his workers would go behind his back and do this to him telling them how much he did for them though he is still ready to sit down with them and work things out <0>
but his inlaw insults charlie and the strike takes place as he turns his attention to his baby and lets sam handle the strike <0>
sam breaks up the strike by using thugs something moses is repelled about and vows to never let something like that happen again <0>
{} but uncle moses way of life radically changes as his wife cant find satisfaction in the marriage even though she tells him that she likes him better than she does her parents <0>
this all gets to moses who will have a heart attack over the strike <0>
he also agrees to divorce masha <0>
he loses interest in running all his businesses and decides to make out a will leaving a quarter of his estate to the workers <0>
{} the times have changed for the immigrant jews as they had to choose between two bad choicesthe false family of the transposed shetl or the emerging false family of the union <0>
moses becomes a symbol of the past as he is relegated to a sentimental and irrelevant role in the future <0>
the last shot in the movie is ultimately a sad one of him coming back to visit his family of workers as he requests one of them to sing a familiar nostalgic melody and he proceeds to tell them a story of what a man is how a man builds houses factories brings his countrymen to america and after all the grave awaits him <0>
{} the evils of american materialism is matched with a disdainful look at the oldworld economics and the old way of arranging marriages of the parents disregarding what their children want and acting as benovolent tyrants over them <0>
america is now a place for inspiration for the younger generation yiddish will not be their firsttongue and the rich opportunities in the new land will take precedence over everything else <0>
masha will be viewed as a victim caught in the changing times who did not marry for money herself but only to please her parents an obligation she believed that she had to fulfill <0>
moses will be looked upon with mixed emotions with some fond memories of him for his charitable nature and some disappointments that he was an exploiter <0>
he will be viewed as a representative from a time when the immigrants were in a transitional state in their new country when they lived in poverty and strived to have their children gain the fruits of the american dream <0>

[21741/a]
{} jacques tourneur the cat peoplethe leopard man based this studio rko film for val lewton on a magazine article of inez wallace but added the jane eyre storyline onto this tale of voodoo in the west indies <0>
he has come up with a possible masterpiece arguably his best film that overcomes a questionable bmovie plot to achieve an elegant memorable and poetic story <1>
{} it is snowing in canada and the young and eager nurse betsy connell dee accepts a job to care for the comatose wife of a sugar planter on a caribbean island called st sebastian <0>
on the ocean voyage she converses with the embittered sugar planter who employed her paul holland conway who warns her that what she takes for beautiful is all underscored by death such as the jumping fish she is admiring as he tells her they are only jumping in fear of being eaten by the bigger fish <0>
meanwhile in the background the black crew are chanting the mournful tune o marie congo as they are absorbed by all the beauty around them <0>
while he strikes for her a rather attractive pose of a byron type perhaps overreacting to his wifes illness by being guiltridden that he drove her toward the critical condition she is in <0>
{} on the island a black coachman clinton fills her in on the islands slave history of how they were brought to the islands in chains on the boat with the figure of st <0>
sebastian on its front now part of pauls home which makes the beauty of the island seem tainted for them <0>
{} betsy upon reaching her destination meets the halfbrother of paul wesley rand james ellison who has a drinking problem and has lost interest in his work at the sugar mill <0>
he speaks despairingly of paul warning her that he is a man of beautiful words but is capable of harming her like he did his wife jessica christine gordon <0>
he leaves for work at the sound of the eerie throbbing of the jungle drums which is only announcing that the sugar syrup is ready to be poured <0>
{} at night she hears the cries of a woman thinking that it is her patient she rushes to her in the darkness of the sleeping area and finds her sleepwalking in a trancelike state <0>
paul comes rushing in upon hearing the nurses shrieks and she is told by the servants who arrive that the cries are from the black maid alma harria who is taking care of a new born child <0>
the maid tells her that the custom on the island is for people to cry at a birth because in the days of slavery babies were born into a life of misery <0>
the reverse is also true that death will bring on sounds of rejoicement because death signifies freedom <0>
{} betsy confers with dr maxwell james bell who believes jessica suffers from tropical fever which has incapacitated her spinal cord leaving her with no will power and unable to speak <0>
she can only obey simple commands and is like a zombie a living ghost <0>
he recommends the nurse restrict her to a light diet and some exercise <0>
{} while in an outdoor restaurant drinking and conversing with wesley betsy hears in the street the startling calypso song sung by sir lancelot which tells of her employers family history which is entitled shame and scandal in the family of how wesley tried to steal pauls wife and brought dishonor to the family <0>
it is interesting to note how this s film had a tolerant and respectful attitude to blacks and even allowed them to be critical of upperclass whites without being rebuffed for it <2>
{} betsy meets the mother of the family edith barrett who is pleased with betsys concern for jessica <0>
she tells the nurse to have paul remove the whiskey from the dining table that she is worried about wesleys growing alcoholism as she recognizes that paul and betsy have an attraction for each other and that she can influence the master of the house he is her first son whose deceased father was the plantation owner to remove this traditionally placed decanter that is always on the family table <0>
{} betsy decides after she is sure that she has fallen in love with paul that jessica must be treated with the only known cure dr maxwell can suggest for her insulin shock therapy which could also result in her death <0>
her purpose is twofold one to help the patient who seems dead already the other to resolve the situation with paul so that if she is cured paul will have his wife back but if she dies she can now go out with paul <0>
but the treatment doesnt work <0>
{} alma says that only the voodoo doctors at houmfort can cure her as the native locals are concerned with the bad feelings derived from having the zombie woman around with no resolvement in sight and would be anxious to help <0>
alma carefully outlines in some flour she spills on the floor how to get there and pins on betsy a patch needed for entry to the voodoo ceremony so that when she reaches the crossroads to the place the zombie guard would let her pass <0>
{} one of the all time greatest scenes in horror movie lore takes place as betsy takes the sleepwalking jessica through the thick jungle of the sugar cane fields while the howling wind and rustling branches and sound of a conch is being blown to bring to the ceremony the faithful <0>
then there are the contrasting light and dark shadow patterns seen in the field and the unmentionable dangers that are imagined in the frightened mind of the brave nurse as she goes silently past the voodoo talismans and the goat carcass hanging from a tree <0>
when they reach carrefour darby the scary looking zombie guard he lets them go on but follows along in a very mysterious way <0>
when betsy shines her flashlight on the guards face after they reach the ceremonial spot at houmfort the voodoo drums begin and the ceremony is started and all this is so much like a dream <0>
{} the ritual voodoo ceremony is done in a deliberate and quietly dignified manner with the result being hypnotic <0>
the worship calls for drums and dance but the surprise is that the high priest is mrs rand <0>
she will later on explain to betsy that when her second husband who was a missionary passed on in order to get the natives to take the proper medicine she pretended that the voodoo god spoke through her and that after she became bitterly disappointed that her sons were fighting over pauls wife she uttered jessicas name in a curse that stuck and jessica has been a zombie ever since <0>
{} the obscure motives of the mother and the nurse and to who was at fault in pauls marriage and what role wesley plays in all this is never cleared up completely by the film but that only makes the story more intriguing <0>
mrs rand is walking in the world of both the christian and voodoo societies and her role in this affair could lead far in speculation even to suggest possibilities that she wanted wesley for herself almost like the part jocasta played in the oedipal myth <0>
{} as for paul we can never be sure if he was the cause of jessica turning away from him or if he was always the brooding intellectual type even before her affair with his halfbrother <0>
jessicas personality is seen differently through the eyes of others but since she was a zombie for the whole film we have no idea what her role was in this indelicate affair <0>
the seemingly innocent betsy seems clever enough to have thought of a solution to this problem that could benefit her <0>
her plan comes about only after she falls for paul <0>
so her motives for helping jessica could be calledin for questioning <0>
{} the natives want the case of the zombie settled they feel there is enough sadness on the island as is <0>
the shaman makes a voodoo doll in the likeness of jessica and the voodoo followers decide to go along with the curse and hold wesley responsible for it <0>
they stick a pin in the doll and send their trusted zombie guard to retrieve her but are foiled by paul and betsy so instead wesley is used to bring about her final death <0>
after he fails to get the nurse to euthanize her he takes an arrow from the figure of st sebastian in front of their palatial home and carries jessica in a zombielike ritualistic manner to the ocean where they both drown <0>
he will now be with his loved one forever <0>
{} the film closes on the image of slavery for the blacks and wealth for the whites the arrowpierced st sebastian the symbol of all the pain suffered by the island people as a voiceover in a serious religious tone declares that death has taken away the evil and implores god to bring joy to the living with forgiveness to all <0>
{} the power of the script is in the telling of a tale about local superstition built around the moral dilemma of what is the christian concept of right and wrong and by creating an unforgettable and haunting atmosphere that blows away the less than sterling acting by the male leads and the unlikeliehood of the story being totally believable <2>
tourneaus direction for this lowbudget film was marvelous and it was spectacularly shot by roy hunt in its chiaroscuro imagery bringing to light a film that is both incredible and magical <2>

[22250/a]
{} the often filmed story of joan of arc but a story that is seldom successfully filmed is attempted again by jacques rivette updownfragile la belle noiseuse la religieuse celine et julie vont en bateau and the results for this epic study of joan are more than pleasing but less than scintillating <1>
{} rivette was born in rouen france in and it is interesting to note that was the year when dreyers magnificent silent version of joan first appeared onscreen which was made as a spiritual testament to joans moral courage <0>
rivette started out as an assistant to jean renoir and later was a camera operator for francois truffaut and eric rohmer <0>
he was a critic at cahiers du cinema and the much praised movie director is now considered to be one of the more noted unorthodox directors around who will be forever associated with the french new wave <0>
{} in joan he divides the minute film into two parts the battles and the prison each requiring a separate admission price and approaches the film mainly from an historical perspective relying on dates and accuracy in detail in telling the tale of the peasants sandrine bonnaire birth in and her reaction to hearing voices from god which started upon hearing saint michaels voice when she was and persisted for the remainder of her life as saint catherine and saint marguerite were the other voices from god she heard the ones who counseled her that she was chosen to save france from the english <0>
the first part of the film will detail how she received from the dauphin marcon her command of the troops at orleans until her victory over the english at tourelles with their general classidas drowned in the loire <0>
{} sumptuously filmed in brilliant color it captures best the wonderful shades of frances fall and wintery colors <0>
{} in the films opening scene the earnest maiden announces to the captain that she has been chosen by god to save france from the english and urges him to take her to see the king <0>
scenes shift as dates change and are so indicated onscreen <0>
on febuary the maiden is escorted to chinon to see the king <0>
she is characterized as someone who is very human but who is possessed by the voices she hears of god and her sense of nationalism <0>
when given a boys doublet to wear having her long girlish hair clipped short and at times given to girlish fits of giggling we see her being transformed from the young girl she is into the soldier for god she envisions for herself <0>
{} we see in rivettes joan that it is her sobering historical story that counts the most and the price joan will pay for that is that when compared with dreyers joan we dont have the same intense passion for her as we do for dreyers more spiritual and intense joan <-1>
in this film it is the kings coldness and the churchs intrigue that strikes us while joan and the soldiers she fights with are given a warm treatment as if they were the heroes in a hollywood war movie <-1>
joan comes across as too nationalistic she seems more like a naive pawn in the hands of evil leaders who was placed in a position that she often didnt fully understand rather than someone who is totally imbued with an allencompassing spirituality <-1>
{} she meets the dauphin without being introduced to him in a crowded room <0>
this turns out to be a way of him testing her to see what power of wit this illiterate nineteen yearold has and it works out well for her as she is able to identify him and the future king takes a shine to her eagerness to serve him and get him crowned king in rheims which is one of her visions that is to take place after she defeats the british in orleans <0>
{} the kings troubles begin with his own mother disinheriting him and the impoverished state of his own financial affairs which result in him being treated without all the due respect he feels he deserves by his subjects <0>
the floundering country is in such a bad state that it is about to be completely taken over by the british <0>
therefore he seems pleased to hear that this naive girl who comes to him with the vision of being the savior of france is ready to go to battle for him <0>
{} her next test of approval is to prove that she heard gods voice and this comes about when a group of clergy in poitiers will question her for three weeks to authenticate her as a real visionary <0>
she tells them what they want to hear i dress like a man because thats my job <0>
saint michael speaks in the language of angels <0>
my sign from god will be proven on the battlefield of orleans <0>
i guess that satisfied the questioners as they stated she said nothing wrong and believes in god and therefore they approve of her as gods emissary for the king of france <0>
{} in april she looks at the british from across the river and is anxious to attack but is met with cautionary responses from the french commander the bastard of orleans patrick le mauff who says we are outnumbered five to one and the wind is blowing the wrong way for our boats to move <0>
in a strongarmed soldier who walks with a limp la hire boucher and in the duke of alencon jeanpierre lorit the kings relative joan meets with bold soldiers who fiercely want to go into battle and they turn out to be just the kind of inspired soldiers she needs for victory <0>
{} in may of joan gets an arrow in the shoulder but after a brief rest continues the frenzied attack on the british until victory is theirs as the first part of the film ends on that high note <0>
part the prison <0>
{} with king charles given the royal treatment and crowned as the french king the church and state are shown sleeping in the same bed politically speaking and the king loses his appetite for further battle after being influenced by his inner circle of advisers to sign a truce with the british and forget about paris <0>
in june joan embarks on a series of french victories over the english throughout the loire valley and when she is ready to seize paris for her king the king tells her to stop <0>
disappointed but not rebelling against her authority figure she goes on her own no longer supported by the king financially fighting in cities outside of paris that are loyal to the english <0>
it is now september of and all her troops are scattered in different directions fighting on their own <0>
with a small band of troops she is captured in may and held prisoner by prince philippe who is loyal to the british and detests king charles for lopping off the head of his father john the fearless <0>
in an arrangement made with the local bishop she is sold to the british and put on trial for heresy by the church it is a deal made in hell <0>
{} caught in the web of a politics she perhaps refused to understand she is faced with death at the stake if she doesnt recant her statements of being gods messenger on earth wearing mens clothes and refuses to submit to the word of the church <0>
by may of she is told by the bishop at rouen to either abjure or burn at the cross <0>
when she decides to save her skin and abjures she is shocked to see that the evil bishop has tricked her and pronounces a sentence of life imprisonment with her to be kept in an english jail where she is to be chained and to be given only bread for pain and water for her sorrows <0>
when the english soldiers taunt her and try to rape her she has enough of this and tells the bishop he has condemned her to death that she could have handled a church prison and lived with excommunication but she would rather die than live in a british prison and not be allowed to hear mass <0>
she says god has pity on me i damned myself to save my life but god sent me <0>
{} her death sentence is assured now as on may she is dressed in a white sack cloth wearing a white dunce hat and given a cross she requests by an english soldier <0>
in an act of hypocritical benevolence the bishop allows her to receive holy communion for the last time <0>
her death scene is as cold as stone there are no outcries the clergy remains adament that they did the right thing getting rid of this socalled virus in the church <0>
the last word is from joan engulfed by the flames at the stake as she cries out for jesus <0>
{} this film seems to be the most accurate version of all the joan films thus far as rivette followed the trial transcripts and whatever history of her battles were recorded by eyewitnesses but it failed to move me in an intimate way as much as the dreyer version did which made more of a personal statement and an artistic response to those in power who try to stifle the voice of an individuals expression while rivette uses the visual epic scope of history to make his point that the call for freedom is not necessarily separate from politics <-1>
he is sympathetic toward joan but i get the feeling he has a healthy skepticism about the voices she hears and her total obedience to authority figures and is not completely sold on all those miracles that seemingly occurred <0>
after all her soldiering was with professional soldiers and her prayers stopped being answered after the king was crowned <0>
perhaps rivettes joan is encapsulated by his choice of sandrine bonnaire as a joan who never lost her beauty her girlishness but also never convinced me fully that she was the sacrificing joan of visions <-1>
her performance was more than acceptable but it was not memorable or moving <1>
rivettes version is good to see as a companion piece to dreyer as they both have things in their films that the other never attempted and though rivettes version is intriguing and colorful and politically savvy it is not a masterpiece <1>
it is just missing that magical ingredient in it the something that dreyer found when he went for the abstractions the something that history couldnt tell <-1>

{} one of the better scifiers to emerge from the s <0>
this one was has ants that have become mutants because of the radiation from atomic bomb tests in white sands new mexico <0>
they have reached giant proportions between tofeet and are attacking people at night during the day the bright light and intense heat bothers them so they remain in their nest <0>
{} the only part of the film that is in color is the red letters of the title <0>
the action starts off in melodramatic form as a traumatized five year old girl sandy descher is picked up by sergeant ben peterson whitmore and officer ed blackburn drake as she is walking in the desert <0>
soon they discover a trailer with the girls dead parents and unusual footprints that no one can determine what it is and the trailer smashed by a terrible force <0>
no money is taken only sugar <0>
go figure its ants that did this <0>
so you cant blame sgt <0>
peterson for leaving his state highway partner blackburn to watch the general store that was destroyed with gramps murdered body as he goes back to interview the girl who is too petrified to speak hoping to get her to tell him what happened <0>
the ants do their thing with the officer as soon as peterson leaves him <0>
this lays a guilt trip on the sergeant even though his precinct captain tells him he followed procedures and did the right thing <0>
since the girls father was a f b i agent on vacation this makes it a federal crime and the f b i is called in to investigate in the person of bob graham james arness <0>
{} when graham sends the footprint to the f b i lab they send them fatheranddaughter entomologists dr harold medford edmund gwenn and dr patricia medford joan weldon <0>
she departs from the plane showing us her pretty calves as she comes down the ladder this is enough for her to get agent grahams attention for the remainder of the film <0>
now dr medford is a real ornery character in a rush to get started in investigating his theory to the cause of the deaths <0>
but first they revive the comatose girl with a concoction of folic acid as she awakens startled and frightened out of her wits yelling its them <0>
{} back to the desert and a sand storm at night for the cops and scientists as pat is attacked by one of the giant ants and we hear the frightening cricketlike sounds they make which is the language they use to communicate with each other <0>
dr medford directs the cops to kill the ant by destroying its antenna thereby it cant see and loses control <0>
he also tells them we got a national crises on our hands as air force intelligence general obrien onslow enter the crime scene with dr medford telling him that this has to be kept top secret or else there will be a panic in the country <0>
{} what ensues is a story relating both to a biblical prophesy the world will be destroyed and to a science gone amok radiation will destroy the world <0>
{} under dr medfords direction the ants nest is spotted and bombed with cyanide and sprayed with flame throwers but two queen ants escape and fly off undetected as dr medford explains that this could be the end of mankind if these ants are not destroyed immediately <0>
they could give birth to thousands of ants and their strength is times their weight which means they could lift a ton also they are very dangerous because they are the only animals other than man who are capable of making war <0>
{} one queen ant is spotted by a pilot fess parker in texas who thinks he saw a ufo in the form of a giant ant flying but is locked up in a mental ward so the secret could be kept from the public <0>
soon one of the queen ants attacks a naval ship and is destroyed which leaves one remaining <0>
{} a patient olin howland in an asylum sees them entering the sewer system in los angeles as he comically keeps telling the military people questioning him about what he sees as he keeps saying the following refrain make me a sergeant and give me the booze <0>
it is these constant little touches throughout the film more so than the special effects that make this film come to life <1>
{} the film ends in fastpaced action after hitting a long stretch of tedium as the public is finally alerted to the dangers and the army goes into the los angeles sewers to get the queen ant <0>
by now months has elapsed since the first ants were spotted and there are scores of other ants in the sewers <0>
the only catch to the army attacking them is that two little boys are in there and it becomes a moral dilemma whether they should lose their lives for the greater concern of the masses or should someone try to rescue them risking the chance that some ants might escape <0>
it is decided that sergeant peterson should go in first and try to rescue the children which he does heroically giving up his life to get the kids to safety as an ant crushes him <0>
{} this film was intelligently presented the special effects were effective enough and the cast especially edmund gwenn all provided fine performances all this adding up to a really decent and subtle film <2>

[17886/a]
{} having lived through and somehow survived the cultural revolutions of the late s and early s american style not fully aware of what the french upheaval was all about except to notice that there was more of an identification over there between the workingclass and intellectuals and not the same usage of hallucinogenic drugs and antivietnam protests that was sweeping the american landscape <0>
i was therefore most interested that this film tackled the subject of revolution totally by looking through the eyes of sexual change <1>
following the trail of a professional idler in his late s alexandre lud who manages not to work own an apartment or possess many material things doing this by living off the women he has affairs with who supply him with food an apartment to share clothes and perhaps even some money <0>
{} we first meet alexandre as he arrives at the sorbonne to get confirmation that his relationship is all over with the coed who just dumped him for another man gilberte isabelle who tells him it is definetly over between them she is marrying this other man <0>
alexandre pleads his case professing his love for her cunningly trying to win her back but to no avail <0>
we subsequently learn that gilberte was a virgin when he met her and even though he treated her badly he still believes he loves her very much <0>
despondent with her decision he comes out of the bohemian cafe he hangs out in deux magots and eyes this very attractive blond <0>
his pickup line to her is i dont have time to have a drink with you but can i have your telephone number <0>
this girl turns out to be veronika lebrun who is the whore of the story a slavic nurse in her s and someone who professes a dire need to have casual sex with as many offers as she can entertain especially enjoying it with exotic outsiders like jews and arabs <0>
going on to tell alexandre that her relationships dont last too long but that men are very attracted to her because she has a big ass nice breasts a sensual mouth and when she wears makeup her eyes appear very sexy <0>
alexandre chimes in that he also likes her when she smiles <0>
{} when alexandre returns to the apartment he shares with his lover the mother of the story the ish wellendowed boutique owner marie lafont who in reallife was the exlover of the director of the film who never acted before but has a strong sexual presence in this film he tells her most everything about what he does including his new lady friend <0>
{} after we see how rakish and supposedly cool alexandre is and hear his amusing rantings about life philosophy and love he sure loves to talk nonstop we also discover that he has a doublestandard about sex being not so free and easy when it comes to having his women folk do the same thing he does to them <0>
{} this take me seriously three and a halfhour film is surprisingly never dull and is always diverting and titillating in its sexual characterization of these three rather likable and vulnerable participants in experimental living that has its ups and downs as far as their compulsive libertine tendencies go <2>
we follow the relationship over a few weeks grow between veronika and him inbetween bouts of too much drinking chain smoking and sharing a bed with the atfirst antagonistic marie but a soon to be more accepting marie until her true feelings emerge again as she attempts suicide but is stopped by alexandre and then we are treated to hearing one of the best i am a whore speeches i ever heard as veronike fesses up to wanting to be loved that sex is really nothing to her even though she enjoys coming the maximum number of times she has some kind of thing about saying maximum whenever she can but is not ashamed that she is free enough to go to bed with whomever she desires claiming that she is better than the hypocrite housewife who dreams of screwing the plumber or some stranger but never acts on her desire <0>
{} confessions and halfbaked philosophies come pouring out of this film at the drop of a fancy scarf as alexandre states he cant love a woman who doesnt love him <-1>
while marie demands that she could have other relationships also just like he does <0>
with all the socalled sexual freedom they have it is discernible that there seems to be a lot of tension around them making one wonder really if they are enjoying themselves more than their bourgeoisie counterparts are <0>
{} alexandres male friend renard also an idler is quite a zany hanging out at the same cafes alexandre frequents showing a keen interest in nazism as a cultural nostalgia and wheeling his able bodied self around in his apartment in a wheel chair stolen from a cripple <0>
all the quirkiness and nonsensical palaver of childish s rebellion is seen here along with a strong sense of connecting with others of the similar mindset allowing sex to be the liberating experience that it should be for them if what they are into is to be taken seriously as some kind of revoluntionary statement <1>
{} the film culminates with alexandre forcing himself into making a choice between the two women who love him and choosing the more youthful blond when she is at her most vulnerable <0>
he asks veronika to marry him as she is vomiting into a bucket as the scene fades out with him sitting in her apartment about to become a married man <0>
this is not your typical hollywood romantic happy ending for a film but one that is very fitting for this film <2>
{} it is worth noting that the director of this seminal work jean eustache killed himself at age in and that certainly some parts of this film were based on his reallife experiences <1>
{} the acting is superb <2>
lud the boyish charmer is selfabsorbed prattling on and on about himself and what he thinks he knows about life that is both comically funny and sad while at all times he acts the part of the compulsive sex freak <1>
the only thing that is impressive about his intellect was that he is often seen carrying a book by proust under his arms as he goes to the cafe to read which is bookmarked to the story about the captive <0>
all the women are special in their roles making us look at them bodilywise as well as at their mind <1>
i see very little differences between the sexual mores and the ones <0>
the later year is when i saw this film on video for the first time <0>
{} how this film plays out depends on ones perspective about sex and relationships and how important they are if perhaps they are the most important worldly concerns one has even more important than money or career or philosophy then this film should prove to not only be entertaining but mindful <2>
if thought of as otherwise then the film could still prove to be a most revealing study of how women look at men especially men who think they are real smoothies <2>
it also should indicate that women often choose these smoothies over other men because they like to play games with men and feel comfortable being around such men <0>
{} what the film accomplishes is to not rely on its plot and on any particular message but to allow things to happen as they normally would relying on the compelling nature of the actors to garner our interest and our natural curiousity about what makes us love one another until it reaches the surface of some common understanding <2>
that this was successfully done can be attested by me from my own experiences and how important sex was for me in forming a relationship during the s it also seemed to shape my attitudes in love and in the sense i had of the world <2>
sex always seems to be revolutionary because it is never static it is never quite done in the same way <0>
{} this film shows no signs of its age it is impressive enough for me to watch today as it was for me to live vicariously through it in my thoughts of the s <2>
i think that the filmmaker could do no wrong in this film every gesture and endless chat seemed so terribly right <2>
and if the film is not an optimistic one then that is just the way the filmmaker saw the situation of the lovers <-1>

[22521/c+]
{} this romantic comedy about the love life of comic book writers feels like a sitcom because that is what it basically is not withstanding that it pushes the envelope further out by having characters in it who are more sexually active than the usual sitcom <1>
its story is also a bit more arresting <1>
its strongest asset being the quickwitted and acidy dialogue it brings to the table by its capable cast who are most able to deliver those punch lines <1>
{} at a comic book fair in nyc comic book writers and longtime friends holden ben and banky jason are signing autographs for their hit comic bluntman and chronic <0>
in this scene we get a good dose of the ambiance of the comic book world and we get a chance to see what their readers are like and of how serious the writers are about the work they do <1>
we learn that they want to be looked upon as artists and not to be taken for intellectual lightweights just because they work in the comic book business <0>
{} a comic book writer alyssa joey is introduced to them by another comic book writer hooper dwight who poses as a black militant hiding from his comic book audience that he is gay <0>
it turns out that holden falls for alyssa and he also thinks they have much in common since they both come from the same town in the new jersey suburbs but what he doesnt realize at first is that she is a lesbian who is unwilling to get into a relationship with a man <0>
their first meeting over a game of darts gives holden what he calls a shared moment banky has a blast with this explanation <0>
{} the wouldbe lovers must take risks to make their relationship work <0>
holden is the first to feel that he must be with alyssa <0>
he has led a sheltered somewhat nerdy life till now still living in the jersey suburbs while alyssa is wild and alluring <0>
she is very sexy having a deepthroaty voice and an open manner that makes it easy to talk to her <0>
but having led a very active sexual life experimenting with all sorts of sexual encounters she comes with a checkered past <0>
holden is able to face up to her lesbian affairs but has difficulty in reconciling her reckless sex with multiple male partners whom she does not even care about <0>
and it disturbs him that he has to find this out through gossip and not from her especially when she seems to make such a big thing about honesty in a relationship <0>
smith does an excellent job in showing the doubts men have about being with a loose woman who they are smitten with <0>
our hero is not a liberated hero but it is his flaws that give him credibility <1>
{} the twist in this story comes about in the part his wiseguy partner plays in trying to destroy their relationship out of jealousy <0>
the film gives this a surprising psychological meaning <0>
the relationship between the three of them becomes an unsmooth one as they all battle the mundane worries most people have in regards to love affairs friendships and how it will affect them and their careers <0>
{} chasing amy is a moral fable <0>
the title of the film derives from the story the director himself tells to holden as he portrays a character called silent bob <0>
he tells them a story about a girl named amy <0>
she is the girl who ran away from him because he didnt know how to handle the situation he was in and he ended up losing the girl he loved <0>
this scene was not needed as the story itself was simple enough to follow <0>
we did not need a ready made explanation of the film from the director <0>
{} not everything worked or made sense but the characters and their problems seemed real <1>
and the dialogue hit the mark more often than not <1>
this is smiths third film about the travails of young people growing up in new jersey and influenced by pop culture <0>
what i didnt like about the film is that despite its attempts not to be viewed as a sitcom that is what this film is even if its mature story line adds more weight to it <-1>
sitcoms are just not the way i like to see drama unfolding as it always leaves me thinking that things are still being dumbed down that even though these are characters we usually do not see on the screen and it is refreshing to see them we are nevertheless not going any deeper psychologically with this story and with character portrayal than other sitcoms go <1>
{} smiths film does give us a real sense of a relationship and the struggle it takes to make it work but there is still an air of superficiality about its presentation <1>

[17912/b]
{} this is a fantasy film that comically depicts one current student making contact with another former student of the same school who is now a tycoon who when he looks back at his high school days might recall what it was about those years that now fill him with nostalgia and how he might be an influence to other students not considered to be top flight students yet who possess the guts it takes to become successful <0>
{} rushmore opens as an irrepressible sophomore at an elite private school the yearold max fischer schwartzman who is the future tycoon is daydreaming that he can solve an impossible math problem his math teacher put on the board for extracredit that no one else in the world can solve <0>
in reality he is a poor academic student having won a scholarship to the school when he was in the nd grade by staging a play that the headmaster brian cox of rushmore academy was impressed with <0>
his father is the town barber but max prefers to tell people that his father is a neurosurgeon <0>
the father is paternally played with a very sweet charm by veteran actor seymour cassel <2>
{} this is an original and quirky story <1>
but it also follows a long tradition of films that took similar routes ferris buellers day off the graduate so what seems to be taking place and in what direction it is going and who max is cannot be simply or absolutely stated which is great in some ways but completely mindblowing in other ways as this somewhat cheesy story has more holes in it than swiss cheese <-1>
yet no matter how it seems to be served it always seems to be a story that is tastefully done <2>
{} max appears with thick spectacles wearing braces and not appealing to girls or not even liked by any one on campus except for a young student he is an advisor to dirk mason who acts as a loyal subject to maxs cause only disillusioned when he hears that max made some sexually disparaging remarks about his mother <0>
max is not exactly a nerd as he is pushy being neither completely likable nor obnoxious who propels himself into the rushmore scene by pursuing extracurricular activities to such a degree that it reaches the point of absurdity as he is involved in so many diverse activities that it is a wonder he has time to even take off the preppy jacket he loves to wear around the campus <0>
the list of his activities includes beekeepers club the dodgeball society the french club the debating team the fencing team editor of the schools paper the piper cub club the max fischer players they put on plays which seem ridiculously overplayed such as serpico in which he directs and stars in <0>
{} rushmore is maxs symbolic place tantamount to that august mountain top where replicas of some of our greatest presidents are carved in stone <0>
it is at rushmore where he is bursting with untold energy for adventure entrepenureship and romance <0>
everything he does is what someone his age might want to do or dream about but he carries it out from fantasy land into the real world not deterred by what others may think of him or of how totally offthewall he appears <0>
oblivious to his poor school work except when the headmaster reminds him that if he doesnt improve his grades he will be expelled from school scholarship or not <0>
{} he falls foolishly in love with a yearold elementary teacher at the school <0>
charmingly played by miss cross williams <1>
who looks bemusedly perplexed at him but nevertheless somehow admires him for the effort he puts forth in stating his feelings for her <0>
her husband recently died but spoke fondly of his attending rushmore which is the reason she chose for coming here to teach <0>
max plans to win her over by building her an aquarium as a token of his affection <0>
the money for this pieinthesky project will come from a steel tycoon herman blume murray whom he met after the former graduate of the school gave a speech there that seemed to only impress him as the tycoon told what the school meant to him in a flippant way that alumni usually dont reminisce about when giving a formal speech in an auditorium <0>
{} blume as the present day tycoon looking back at his days at rushmore as the springboard of his success just as he looks back at his marriage with remorse develops a natural kinship with max the tycooninwaiting <0>
that is beautifully presented by an understated performance by murray who draws comedy by just raising an eyebrow at the right moment or when befuddled lighting two cigarettes in his mouth and who evinces pathos when he seems inundated by his dislike of himself for the unfeeling person he has become <1>
{} there are many twists to come into play as the story is disarmingly told forcing us not too get too comfortable in what we expect to be a sane commentary of the goingons here <0>
the twist in the story that works best and is both hilariously amusing and deadly serious is that blume trapped in a loveless marriage falls for the teacher also and is able to romance her <2>
max acts particularly upset by this turn of events venting out at all the parties he perceives are hurting him <0>
these scenes were wickedly cruel to comprehend as the story flipped over from comedy to psychological drama and to a certain extent a temporary suspension of belief <0>
yet it was this facet of the story that was most novel and daring about the film as it let the characters freely play out who they were without contrivance <2>
therefore even if you didnt particularly care about the way things were going you were at least taken aback by seeing how everyone interacted with each other <1>
max showing himself to be rude and insulting going to great lengths to end the relationship between the two lovers somehow believing that he should have been taken seriously as a real suitor <0>
blume retaliating by smashing the kids bike <0>
max getting back at blume by cutting the brakes to blumes bentley <0>
miss cross by showing that shes a sensitive and vulnerable woman who wants to feel alive and romantic and doesnt really understood that she is being wooed by men who cant take no for an answer <0>
this is the part of the film that i had the most problems with especially when we see her going out with an attractive doctor luke a harvard graduate like she is and he seems to be the odd man out for no decipherable reason that the story expands on <-1>
{} when max gets kicked out of rushmore and goes to the inferior public high school he continues to do poorly in his school work but will excel once again in extracurricular activities even putting on an antivietnam war play with live ammo requiring the audience to put on earplugs and wear goggles <0>
he even finds an oriental girlfriend tanaka who is not quite the scientist she seems to be which in this case is a good thing because that makes her just about right for max <0>
{} the young directors previous film bottle rocket was also written by him with owen wilson it was also quirky but a bit less professionally done <-1>
both films show promise of better things to come <1>
there are still patches to this story that need further developing and to be pruned along the edges before we can say we have things in order <-1>
but after saying that i must say that this is still a firstrate film with a lot of bite to it depicting characters in a discrete way that allows them to be very real and formidable <2>
this is bill murrays best role yet and for newcomer jason schwartzman the son of actress talia shire a role made for him in filmdom heaven <2>

[20473/d]
{} this scifier left a lot to be desired <1>
it didnt work out in d its original intention of how it was to be shown as the publics taste for that fad cooled or in the conventional d how it was actually shown when released <0>
for the first minutes or so i felt i was stuck in a detention classroom for dummies ah those childhood memories never seem to go away as there was one pedantic lecture after another trying to explain the secret experimental work being done underground in a new mexico lab with five different levels of depth and a giant mirror out front to deflect the suns rays that if directed upon a target would easily burn it up <0>
a weapon that was reputed to be more potent than the hbomb and something that america the good guys were going to put up in outer space so that they could control the world from their enemies <0>
{} ivan tors is the producer and the one who wrote the story that the film is based on <0>
he also foisted his wife constance dowling on the film as the lead actress <0>
her problem was that she was stiffer than a stiff in her romantic role as joanna merritt <0>
she is a plant from washington spying for them about what is happening on the secret project <0>
she previously had a romantic relationship with the lead investigator dr david sheppard egan who was just flown in at the request of the centers director dr van ness herbert marshall <0>
her job now becomes to help dr sheppard track down the mysterious malfunctions taking place at the center <0>
this was the last film she appeared in after a brief film career working previously as a samuel goldwyn girl <0>
{} during these cold war years machines were regarded with apprehension by the public who were worried that the enemy would out do america in science and have weapons that will blow them up <0>
that the plot of the film would be about two robots gog and magog built in a neutral european country but who enemy agents were able to slip into it a radio transmitter that was not detected by american security highlights the american paranoia about foreigners and machines controlling the world <0>
even if these machines could do a times the work man can do they were also a times deadlier than man and this reactionary story dwells on the negative side of what machines could do even if the machine in this instance is a magnificent brain <0>
{} herbert marshall has an uninspiring role as the man in charge of this project which is the installation of the first manned space station built <0>
this station will be sent to outer space upon its completion <0>
the base is under the command of novac an anagram for nuclear operated variable automatic computer <0>
what all the fuss is about is if american knowhow can save the world for democracy as the project comes under attack <0>
since novac has been compromised by those whove reprogrammed the computer to undermine the spacestation project and have ordered novac to dispatch the two robots to kill the scientists and the project itself its now up to dr sheppard to stop those robots <0>
{} the action in the film which is none too thrilling is in watching how many of the workers will get killed and what novel ways are the killings to be done <-1>
there will also be some action scenes involving the ruggedly handsome b actor and former school teacher richard egan putting a flame thrower to the robot which will enable america to launch its space station uninterrupted <0>
{} if the film was funny or its technology was more interesting or if the killings werent so melodramatic and the acting not so staid and the patriotic jingoism wasnt so shrill i might have found this film bearable <-2>
but since that wasnt the case i found the film to be an academic bore <-1>

[20454/d]
{} a satirical film where warren beatty tries to talk the black mans rap to get across his political message which is that theres something wrong in politics that corrupts everyone in it <0>
he plays a selfdestructing liberal democratic california senator bulworth pretty close to bullshit who is running for reelection in and is suffering from despondency after several sleepless nights <0>
he is unhappy with the phony he has become so his solution is to hire an unknown hit man to kill him <0>
he also takes out a million dollar life insurance policy for his teenage daughters benefit with an insurance representative who is influencing his vote on some impending insurance legislation <0>
{} but something happens to him along the way to a south central l a black church where he decides to tell the truth <0>
maybe he does this because he feels relieved that hes going to die soon <0>
anyway he starts chastising the congregation for following the guilty o j simpson and not fighting for the real needs of the community such as the failure of innercity schools and developing local businesses and filling the need for black leaders to replace those who got killed in the s and s and he blames himself and all politicians for taking the easy money the corporations give to make sure their side is always taken care of <0>
tossing aside a prepared speech about the country that starts off saying we stand on the doorstep of a new millennium <0>
instead he tells the black congregation that the government doesnt care about them because they dont contribute enough money to reelection campaigns <0>
beatty believes that is the problem with the country the great divide between the havesandthe havenots must be resolved and that the politicians will always support those who contribute to them and ignore those who have no power unless there is some kind of election reform <0>
{} he encounters a sexy black woman in the church nina halle who reinvigorates him reminding him how he once thought of himself as a liberal democrat who cared about the truth but who has now lost the way and seems no different than the republicans <0>
she takes him to a hiphop club and he sheds his whiteness in favor of the black mans rap which he will ridiculously imitate for the remainder of the campaign to the initial fright of his campaign staff led by oliver platt in the role of a stereotypical flunky no new acting ground is broken here as the main comedy of the film comes about as the sleazy pratt adopts to any view that keeps him in power <0>
the other key staff member is his veteran campaign advisor jack warden who plays his minor role lowkey trying to go with his successful meal ticket as far it could take him <0>
{} invited to speak before a largely jewish crowd of supporters in the entertainment field he tells them they make crappy films and are only interested in making money <0>
at a business luncheon he insults the big contributors to his campaign such as paul sorvino who is head of an insurance corporation that gives him campaign money and money under the table to block an insurance bill that would help the indigent <0>
{} falling for nina meeting her family in their house he leaves the house and goes strolling in the hood and ends up trying to be a combo of jerry lewis and james cagney in one body helping some drug dealing boys in the street from getting beat on by a racist cop <0>
this is an awkardly embarrassing scene that was more embarrassing than funny to watch beatty try to ingratiate himself this way to his black brothers <-1>
it reminded me in an analogous way of the liberals in the s who invited the black panthers into their wealthy homes and thought they were so chic <0>
{} bulworth also decides he is beginning to have some fun or maybe its the weed and coke that got to him as he tries to get a hold of the hit man and call off the job <0>
the most unbelievable scene in the filma scene that was just too gooey to take without asking what beatty was thinking ofwas the conversion of the local drug dealer cheadle to the cause of the community after hearing one of beattys speeches on tv <-1>
even frank capra wasnt that schmaltzy <-1>
{} meanwhile cnn is interviewing him and cspan is following him around in a truck not understanding where he is going with this new image change <0>
the story gets too ridiculous at this point to even be satirical or credible it is just bad filmmaking but it does try in its unclear and scrambled way to blame the media and the rich people who control it for not being risk takers and offering fresh arguments into the political fray <-1>
in his contemptuous style which hides a selfrighteous anger he sounds more preachy than a sidney lumet does in network as he seems to have retained an old liberal paternalistic style towards blacks from back in the days of the s and s that he cant shake <-1>
{} amiri baraka poet playwright supposedly a voice of consciousness plays a homeless wiseman who keeps popping up from scenetoscene uttering this heavy stream of consciousness rap we need no more ghosts we need a spirit <0>
{} the fault of the film is that beatty cant gracefully pull off what he is trying to accomplish without appearing to be smug about it like hes the white man who knows best what to do and that anything he does is super cool because he really cares about the blacks and the poor sic <-1>
his naive solution for race problems is to have the races fornicate together and have a mixed racial country <-1>
{} everyone in the film is a cardboard prop for beatty to lay it into them with his political cliches <-1>
{} just when i thought wag the dog was the stupidest political comedy i ever saw along comes this sophomoric venture showing no plausible way of replacing the old lies of senator bulworth with his new socalled truths and as a result it is a film that out wags the dogs tail in silliness and prattle unable to have the demented bulworth say what he would do when elected except what is implied that the people will trust him because hes so hip and daring and hes just so with it <-1>
there was a smugness about this film that made its childish political voice seem more annoying than it should be even taking away any enjoyment that might have been derived from its comic efforts <-2>
this is just a bad film that tried to say something about social injustice the class differences between the rich and the poor the unfair loss of welfare programs the inhibiting cost of health insurance that is falsely being blamed on the government when it is the fault of insurance companies why the rates are so high the hypocrisies of the gulf war and the failure of the media to be more responsive in covering all the political corruption <-2>
beatty is just not the filmmaker i would want telling my side of the story <-1>
he has a way of glossing over his once real candidates foibles bobby kennedy and gary hart while pretending to have answers that he doesnt have or at least doesnt present them that well in the film <-1>
all he has done is make a film that is cliched and overbearing and funny in a not funny way and he sounds no different or trustworthy than the politicians he features in the film clinton and dole <-1>
and i dont mean that as a compliment <-1>

{} this film doesnt claim to capture the accuracy of its shakespeare production it even relishes in the inaccuracies it presents ex there were no virginia tobacco plantations during that time frame there was no virginia but the film exuberates in the fun filled spirit and the frolicking nature of the performers and the backbiting that goes on backstage as it might have been in a production of a shakespearian play <0>
the theme of the film is picked up from the literati speculations that a mysterious woman became the living muse who inspired shakespeares romeo and juliet <0>
here she is admirably played by paltrow whose impeccable english and regal stature makes her a most endearing viola for shakespeare fiennes to fall madly in love with <2>
{} i had no problem adopting myself to the cleverness of tom stoppards screenplay though i am usually turned off by films that think they can get by on that one note <1>
but this film was witty and except for a penchant to become at times a cliched formula plot type of film borrowed from thousands of other films you know the old underdog against the world story with the underdog winning the big event in the film in this case poor will shakespeare against the establishment that part of the film took away the fresh and innovative dash the film seemed to have on its own terms <1>
{} but i was nevertheless impressed by the carefree spirit of this romantic comedy it seemed to encapsulate a feeling for those times when a great poet had to be popular in order to be recognized as great <1>
in school we are usually forced into believing shakespeare is only for the high brows not realizing that shakespeares plays were popular and written and spoken so that the common man could understand them <0>
that shakespeare was a great bard there is no argument <0>
but that he was at times too worldly is fair criticism <0>
this film is very clear about that as a fictionionalized version of shakespeare or not <1>
{} his rivalry with christopher marlowe rupert as to who is the better playwright of the time was amusingly done showing the vanity and grace of both rivals <0>
i was not taken as much with fiennes fiery performance as acceptable as it is as much as i was with the rest of the cast and especially paltrows very appealing performance <-1>
fiennes shakespeare seemed a little too flighty for my taste i just dont think will was like that and despite this fictonalized account of will it still bothered me to see him look so lost at times <-1>
the only performer who seemed to be in the wrong film was ben afflecks ned alleyn <-1>
you should talk shakesperian english if you are in a shakesperian production <-1>
{} henslowe rush seemed to have some of the best lines in the film playing the shifty producer willing to try anything to stay in show business <0>
when asked who is that addressing the actors by the plays financier hugh fennyman wilkinson who will soon comically become stage struck he says thats no one important thats the author <0>
judi dench queen elizabeth played the queen with authority mopping up the screen when she was on with her commanding presence and sharp tongue going at full steam <0>
{} i found it to be an enjoyable film full of life and tongueincheek humor to sustain its colorful story within a story of the needy will on the advice of a therapist told to seek some romance to regain his writing ability <2>
will thusly goes about with the staging of his play and is faced with the political and financial problems that always seem to plague theater people and with his own hapless love for viola which is complicated by her high birth and his low birth and that she is promised by her father to the coldhearted lord wessex firth who is a nasty character adding additional spice to the story <0>
this all added to the splendid feel the director gave to this period piece that rises a little above a typical work of this nature as the parts of the film that were fictionalized were intriguingly and cleverly done for the most part <2>
what was a lull in the film was when its story got too clever for itself and resorted to too much ado over nothing <-1>
{} but after all there is something mysterious about show business that draws us into its bosom and allows miracles to happen for this notsoserious look at shakespeare to be dazzling and refreshing something shakespeare might have looked at with wonder speculating at who this shakespeare is he is seeing on film <2>

[18136/a+]
{} a wonderful noirtype of film that is actually more about style and ambiance than it is about what usually underlines the dark themes of the ticklish noir film subjects that delve into the underbelly of their protagonist and evoke a certain sense of injustice in the world <1>
all that is superfluous to bob the gambler in this film he is more interested in taking care of his trenchcoat and fedora and giving handouts to those he likes than he is in doing anything else but looking good <0>
this is a story about a compulsive gambler roger who lives well in paris without working living by his own code of ethics and ability to live off his gambling <0>
impulsively one day when he runs into a bad losing streak he decides to get a crew together to rob the deauville casino a place where he believes there is million francs in the vault but is an almost impossible job to do <0>
with a recklessly cool nonchalance our hero gathers his crew together despite all the obstacles in front of him including betrayal in his ranks and the fact that his police friend knows that he is going to commit the crime <0>
{} the film is so beautifully filmed reflecting the lighthearted charm and wit of the main character and the sleaziness of the part of the city he loves <2>
as the camera kindly follows him as he makes his rounds at night until he is finished playing craps and cards driving down the sordid streets of montmartre entering the lowlife parts of the pigalle section watching out in a protective way for a young attractive yearold corey who he sees eating french fries and then getting pickedup by a sailor on a motorbike <0>
she as the femme fatale in this film will prove to be too willing to sleep with anyone to forge ahead but this does not deter bob from liking her and treating her with respect as bob slowly drives by in his sleek caddy convertible taking notice of the street as if he were the one responsible for its vivacity and sanity thusly finding her again in his favorite bar this time talking to a pimp he cant stand <0>
so bob gives her a decent meal and some cash and the key to his room but does not take advantage of her instead makes it easy for his young protege daniel to move in on her <0>
{} this is so much a movie about how the young and old can be screwups but are still okay with themselves seemingly daring life to keep them from what they want to be <0>
the now middleaged bob in his younger days got caught robbing a bank and spent time in jail for it <0>
he claims to be living a crime free life for the past twenty years enjoying his flashy lifestyle acting as freely as he can not looking back at things that went wrong <0>
by the films end we are convinced that we know a lot about bob and come to the conclusion that hes a pretty good guy thinking to ourselves even though he is linked to gambling and crime nevertheless he does possess a wonderful character about him something that is worthy of our praise <1>
{} a great film that is shot with perfection capturing the nuances and finesse a master filmmaker brings to his work while shooting a lowbudget bw film that tells a simple story but is done with such effervescence as to make us feel so much the better that we at least met this perfectly flawed character even if it is only on film since for most of us it is more than likely we will not have the chance to meet the likes of a true character like him in person <2>

{} wim wenders the end of violence paris texas lisbon story made the very touching documentary buena vista social club in collaboration with guitarist ry cooder who had found the aging musicians in cuba in musicians neglected after castro came to power <0>
they range in age from the s to the s as they play the music they recorded in the s and s <0>
the buena vista social club nonesuch an album of the cuban musicians became such a hit that it sold a million copies and also won a grammy <0>
the movie is a mixture of their music lifestyles and an apolitical quick peek at an impoverished havana <0>
it is done in a wonderfully nostalgic manner as wenders becomes an admiring fan of theirs allowing us to see how humble and human these most talented musical souls are <1>
{} we start out at their day concert in amsterdam then go back to havana and see them free associate and tell something candid about themselves including their biography and then we go to their finale concert in carnegie hall new york <0>
{} wenders has done a good job highlighting them though i would have liked to have seen more of their music as performed in carnegie hall instead of seeing an overabundance of shots showing how well they were received there and how appreciative they were of that rousing welcome <1>
{} ibrahim ferrer is the mellifluous sounding yearold singer who was shining shoes all these years before being part of cooders tremendous coup <0>
if we followed the way of possessions he says wed have been gone a long time ago he has faith in a walking stick his dead mother left him some years ago as a source of luck <0>
the yearold cigar factory roller and cigar smoking guitarist compay segundo tries unsuccessfully but with some amusement to find where the club they once played in existed <0>
segundo boasts of being the father of five and playfully says he still hopes to sire a sixth child tearful joy fills the eyes of the yearold omara portuondo as she sings the bolero silencia in a duet with ferrer which takes place in a recording studio <0>
ruben gonzalez the yearold who some in the group think might be one of the very best pianists in the world as he rises to the challenge in carnegie hall smiling effusively with a warm glow covering him as he basks in the applause he receives <0>
he didnt even own a piano before the film was made <0>
barbarito torres who is much younger than the others plays his unique string lutelike arabian instrument called the laud while the camera records the decaying paint on the seaside buildings and the sensual music played recalls a grand past that no longer exists <0>
{} can such music make a dilapidated cuba bearable <0>
it sure seems that way as there is a consuming joy that sweeps across those who come into contact with these naive but friendly souls <1>
their genuine camaraderie for each other and love of country and gentleness shines through as much as all the wonderful music they play <1>
{} in carnegie hall they sing that lively song entitled el cuarto de tula with the words fire fire im burning up call the fireman tulas room is all ablaze <0>
as their performance goes on wenders follows three of the group into manhattan as they look up at the tall buildings in awe and gravitate to a tacky souvenir store where celebrities and u s presidents as statues are greatly admired by the childlike musicians who are having the time of their life wandering down seventh avenue and feeling so elated at seeing the radio city music hall <0>
they tell each other it doesnt get any better than this <0>
{} i wonder how much longer castros communist revolution will go on <0>
its an obvious failure as even these great musicians were not recognized by the cuban government it took an outsider to do it <0>
near the films end the camera pans back to havana and a banner proclaims we believe in dreams <0>

{} the new star wars trilogy as a prequel to the star wars saga will go back in time a full generation to tell the story of anakin skywalker the innocent boy who will one day become the dreaded darth vader who was the father of luke skywalker the young farmboy who became a hero in the struggle to overthrow an evil empire and had to confront one of the empires staunchest henchmen darth vader <0>
{} in this movie that goes beyond the boundaries of what a movie is because it has become a trademark name that is as easily recognized as any popular brand name is if i mentioned kfc you would know that i am talking about a fastfood chain that sells fried chicken ugh and if i mentioned star wars ah the same familiarity would ring a bell with you <0>
since the movie first surfaced in it has been a very popular film basically overtaking many other types of films that took on the moral battle of good and evil such as the western and it created a new myth that does not challenge the old myth but incorporates pieces of mythology not only from the judeochristian roots of the bible but from the eastern religions as well <1>
it has become so commercially successful a film and enterprise that even though the film cost about million dollars to make its profit margin is a sure thing since it has merchandise deals tied into its release that are estimated to be around billion dollars <0>
{} with this in mind there can be no ordinary viewing of this film since it is already hyped and promoted beyond any reasonable level of expectation it is therefore hardly likely that it could meet such expectations even with its fanatical fan base willing to stand on long lines for a long time in order to get tickets and who will most likely see the film a number of a times and a public that is primed and ready for the product <0>
how many times will viewers want to see it is hard to gauge at this early date though what is guaranteed is that it will draw large crowds and pump life into the movie industry as many will see this film as an event therefore making it criticproof and ensured of being a legendary film no matter what might be perceived of it on screen <0>
{} what takes place on screen if i can consider myself a voice of moderation on this subject is not as terrible a storyline and acting job as one could be led to believe by listening to some film critics nor is it as great a film as many unabashed fans might think who feel taken with the innovative specialeffects and are really caught up in the aura and excessive exuberance the total films package presents to them from john williams recognizable star war themes to some original musical scores he added as special for the film <0>
there should be something in this film for everybody to like especially in a thx theater where the digital sound system and wide screen is best suited for viewing it <1>
the tremendous effort put into the details and scope of its project makes it seem stupendous at times and even throughout the film when there are lulls in its story it still sets a very galactic mood that is trancelike and illusionary in a positive hypnotic sense <2>
but it does suffer at times from being too talky and lacking enough emotions and depth in its story and in its characters and is scripted with a banal dialogue plus there is no romance in it which makes it a film that is more geared to a younger audience an audience that will be around to follow all the other episodes that will surely come forth <-2>
{} as a positive feature of the film it is not interested in gratuitous violence and for that it scores high marks as there is no blood in it as all the action scenes involve mostly robotic things being dismantled <1>
{} as we read the screen for the opening scene we learn that two jedi are off to arbitrate a dispute caused by the trade federation against the planet naboo that is being interfered with unjustly by the federation who are blockading it <0>
the two jedi sent are master jedi quigon jinn liam neeson who is a firsttimer to the star wars series and his apprentice ben obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor who was played by alec guinness in episodes iv v and vi <0>
they encounter difficulties and get caught in a trap sprung by the evil darth sidious ian mcdiarmid who wants to take over the galactic republic and they are forced to use their lightsabers to fight their way out of the jam which they successfully do then realizing that they could use someone familiar with this planet to be their guide as they escape naboo they use this thing they came upon when entering naboo someone named jar jar binks ahmed best a nonstop talking and jittery alien who is some sort of a combination of a frog who acts like a cartoon creature that children could gravitate to but whom i found somewhat offensive because of his speech patterns which were subservient and stereotypical like hollywood sometimes uses to depict certain ethnic groups only in this case he is only a representative of these gungan creatures on naboo except he did talk in a west indian patois <0>
{} after the jedi rescue the year old queen amidala natalie portman from the planet and her favorite droid rd they are forced to land due to broken parts in a remote desert planet called tatooine that is not part of the federation <0>
here the jedi meet anakin skywalker jake lloyd a slave child born by means of immaculate conception working for a junkman that has the parts to fix the space craft <0>
quigon jinn recognizes in ani the possibility of him being the chosen one that is a special jedi with a tremendous potential in the force though there is also a sense of uncertainty about him <0>
darth maul ray park is the evil force with jedilike powers who is sent here by sidious to track and kill the jedi and prevent help for the people of naboo <0>
{} the pace of the film picks up with its most innovative addition an exciting and i might add dizzying racing sequence featuring pod space ships as ani has to win the race to gain freedom for himself and for the jedis to get their needed space craft parts as a wager is made with anis junkman boss on the pod race <2>
this is pure video game stuff that should thrill its younger audience perhaps more than it did me but it was effective and added something new to the star wars legend <1>
{} what gives star wars all its charged up energy are its great duels with lightsaber weapons as good versus evil is clearly the theme that propels it and here the duels are accomplished in a topnotch fashion better than in other episodes <2>
as the villain with a painted blackandred tattooed devils face and short horns and menacing sneers and graceful martialarts movements darth maul battles the master jedi <0>
admirably portrayed by a low key liam neeson in a role that he doesnt seem to be having much fun in but is nevertheless convincing as a wise jedi <1>
teaching his more rambunctious apprentice jedi ewan mcgregor the ropes as they both have a chance at dueling with darth maul <0>
{} delving into the evil nature of politics there is the dual role played by ian mcdiarmid as senator palpatinedarth sidious cast perfectly as a shadowy villain and a hypocritical senator who in future episodes will become emperor palpatine and should provide more chills for viewers to reckon with <0>
without its frightening villains star wars would be stripped of its soul <1>
{} some of the actors did not impress me enough as the above mentioned <-1>
it is probably not fair and not nice to criticize a youngster like jake lloyd who plays anakin skywalker but i thought that though he was sometimes bearable to see on the screen as when he played with his computer toys he was nevertheless miscast and did not have the skills to pull off the difficult role he was asked to fulfill <-2>
anikins mother the great swedish actress pernilla august is just right for the part in fact she is too good for the part <1>
because she makes the boy seem very amateurish and not caring enough when he is teamed with her and cant respond with the proper emotional responses expected from his role <-2>
while she is fluid and graceful in her role even though she is stuck in a wooden part <1>
{} there were nondistinguished cameos by samuel l jackson and terrence stamp that have neither added nor distracted anything from the film <0>
i would have preferred seeing unknown actors in those minor roles giving them a chance to get known and earn some bread <0>
{} some of the more exciting scenes that werent crammed too tight with every computerized gizmo lucas could throw at us so that we were literally choking on too much alien and droid consumption came from the just gorgeous and eye pleasing set designs on the planets <1>
such as the submerged underwater city on naboo filled with dangerous sea monsters and a coliseumlike stadium on tatooine where the pod race transpired covered by talking head sports personalities <0>
then theres coruscant the republics capital a planet where the single city encompasses the entire globe <0>
with its soaring skyscrapers and a sky filled with exotic spaceships and its views of the world that was just too stunning to fully grasp <0>
that is where the council chamber is where queen amidala makes a plea for her people amidst the overwhelming effects of the senate chamber floating in space <0>
all these space landscapes gave the film all the color and spectacle it could ever need making it a most entertaining and enjoyable movie experience <2>
which is really what this movie is all about anyway since i find it difficult to get too worked up over its so called new mythology joseph campbell blessed or not since this movie only expresses what is just a shell of what myths can mean to a society <-1>
be that it as it may i do understand that many feel that what is missing in todays society is some kind of positive myth that there is something that has gone wrong with our culture and this film does offer some encouragement for those who feel movies have caused a certain amount of degeneracy in this countrys cultural war and they should be pleased that lucass film reasserts his personal belief that good can triumph over evil as many feel restless and unsure about the world they live in and need reassurance that we have the same positive values other generations of americans have had and they should look forward to seeing a film such as this one that has such a rosy outlook <1>
{} and again it should be remembered that this is an action film that lives for its battle scenes that has the bad guy droid army fighting the good guy army of naboo in a computer game war as the victorious naboos feel the pride and relief of victory over their enemy for the moment as the film ends with the insidious senator palpatine taking over the galactic chancellorship <0>
{} it is a movie about the taming of nature in the future but made for the age we live in and will be remembered by future movie viewers not for its trite dialogue but as a step up the ladder in our technical and computer skills and in our deep yearnings to find hope in the world we live in <2>
it seems regretable that we have to wait three more years for the next installment of these episodes to be released <1>
i would say that this imperfect film is still a nottobe missed film and even if it has become tiedin with corporate america nevertheless george lucas used his great technical skills to make this film as artistically good looking as he could not aiming to make an exploitive film <1>
and for that we should all be grateful <1>
i have immensely enjoyed the film for what it was and was not overly concerned about what it was not <2>
{} i think it is fair to say that when you plunk down your money and see this film you will be getting your moneys worth <1>
may the force be with you <0>

{} marta maja is a dogooder <0>
she sees a boy crying while she is in a rush to go to work and still stops to help him with the problem he is having with his teacher <0>
this is the same teacher her son has <0>
so she ends up meddling telling the teacher what to do which causes the teacher to take it out on her son and fail him <0>
she works as an accountant in an office and is also the union representative where she gets a chance to help her friend and confidante out who is accused of stealing <0>
she still insists on helping her friend even though her friend talks to her boss about her behind her back which the boss tells her about <0>
all she can say is that she needs my help because she is weak <0>
{} by chance she gets a lift to work by a former acquaintance someone she hardly remembers a handsome trainer jacek marek piwowski <0>
an attraction develops between the middleaged woman and the athletic and free spirited jacek who tempts her with his casual air and sophistication that comes from traveling the world but she cant decide whether to leave her husband jan halina or to stay with jan and try to make the marriage work for the stability of the family even if the marriage has lost a lot of its romance <0>
what makes her decision difficult is that she cant cheat on her husband without feeling guilty so she says that her choice will have to be to leave him or stay with him as a faithful married wife <0>
what also makes her decision difficult is that jan is such a decent guy who does nothing wrong he does not even try to tell her what to do when he picks up on what is going on <0>
{} marta gets to know herself and what other people think of her as she agonizes over her decision <0>
she learns that others think her dogooder nature causes more harm to others than good that if she cant help in a positive way she should step aside and let the other person fend for themselves that she does this because she is a selfindulgent person <0>
{} by putting herself through an emotional ringer marta does find out about what she is really made of and what her marriage means to her <0>
she is strengthened by the experience in a way that she has never felt before <0>
{} the acting was convincing but the story didnt have enough suspense in it to sustain interest especially when the ending was becoming increasingly predictable as the story wore on <-1>
what interested me in a rather oblique way was how tired life in poland seemed and how the real enemy seemed to be the bureaucratic nature of the country that was offhandedly touched upon in the scenes at work as the love triangle waned in my interest <1>
i thought of how different things were in america during that time frame of the s and how similar bureaucracies seem to be wherever they exist whatever the time frame is <0>

{} this is a hopelessly romantic film that traces in three parts the lives of two children who fortuitously meet as eight year olds and feel destined to each other for different reasons who as teenagers consumate their love and when adults they have been separated for a long time try desperately to find each other again <0>
their lives are compared to how mythical and circular things are and how ones fate is circular and how it is not fate alone but free will that determines what happens <0>
{} two eight year olds attending nearby boys and girls schools who both happen to have palindromic names otto fele martinez otto as an adult and ana najwa nimi ana as an adult which is one of many coincidences that spains influential film director julio medem the red squirrelearthcows uses to tell his dour love story about romantic obsession and fate <0>
the two children form a year relationship from their casual meeting over a soccer ball lost in the woods and from a question posed on a paper airplane flown out of the school bathroom window by otto and retrieved in the adjacent schoolyard by ana who says it is too lovely a question about love for any boy to have written <0>
the audience is not told what that question was except that one student says as he recovers one of the many paper planes flown with the same question written on it its corny <0>
another student says its embarrassing <0>
in truth those comments crossed my mind about many aspects of this film as i waivered about my feelings toward the story as spellbinding as the overall film was because the story in parts did feel corny <-1>
{} whats important about that unseen question that ottos father says is the most important one in life and anas mother says how romantic it is is that it links the parents together as they meet each other through their children on the day otto flew all those paper planes onto the school grounds and when ottos divorced father alvaro novo is taking otto back home to his german mother from school <0>
the parents hit it off and become lovers driving the children home from school everyday from now on and will soon get married so that in a rapidly short period of time the children go from being strangers to being acquaintances to being brother and sister and then to being secret teenage lovers <0>
{} the film can be told either backward or forward in time which plays up its palindrome theme it starts from the plane crash at the end of the film and it haphazardly veers back from there to the beginning and later portions of their lives as the story is interpreted through the eyes of either ana or otto with sometimes different versions of the same scene being told <0>
{} medem makes a symbolic point about relating the childrens lives to a circle where there is no real ending or beginning to their story <0>
otto states that every life should include numerous circles and the arctic circle becomes one of the symbolic physical circles used as it becomes the location where the frustrated yearold lovers will meet for the last time after their real life seems to be going around in circles <0>
there are several other symbolic devices that are used by medem a bit more obtusely like empty gas tanks and one of those images might even be considered prophetic the repeated image shown of a car stopping short of a collision with a red bus <-1>
{} the solid story is befuddled with versions showing how the imagination of the two differs from the supposed reality of the story which should leave the audience scratching their heads to try and figure out what is actually happening <-1>
but the straight story goes something like this ana interprets her first meeting with otto in the woods to be an omen that her father is trying to communicate with her as she has just received the news from her mother olga maru that her father died in a car crash <0>
by believing that he is reincarnated as otto and speaks to her through him she finds a satisfying sort of solace with her fathers death <0>
otto did not know what to make of this chance meeting with her but was strongly attracted to her and felt they shared a true bond and that she will be a part of his destiny <0>
{} and destiny is one of the subtexts that medem coyly toys with as we learn that otto got his name from a german nazi pilot who flew a bombing mission over guernica during the spanish civil war and crashed his plane but was rescued by ottos grandfather <0>
otto has from early on had an obsession with planes and will grow up to become a pilot and will eventually meet that same pilot in finland who had married a spanish woman he met while trying to escape from spain <0>
when he meets the pilot his wife is already dead as that is in tune with the theme of the film where a loved one either dies is not found or gets divorced <0>
the story stretches the coincidences to a point of incredibility and becomes more tainted with its philosophical message than a typical romance film usually is as medem carries out the argument that both reality and fiction can be likened to a series of circles that interconnect through the efforts of coincidences that may not make sense to our mortal eyes but these circles are present in either physical places or in events taking place in ones life <0>
{} happiness does not last forever nothing does according to medem and into the couples seemingly tranquil new marriage comes a major setback the stepmother cheats on ottos father with no reason given except it is implied that these things just happen just like alvaro left his wife for no particular reason <0>
the other man is not only also named alvaro but he is the son of the german pilot ottos grandfather rescued and he will marry olga and ottos father who was madly in love with her will become a broken and lonely man as a result of the separation <0>
the teenage otto who was living with his german mother all this time moves out of her house to be with the only female he loves more than his mother as he now lives under the same roof with ana <0>
but this breaks his mothers heart and she drops dead one day when she is cleaning lettuce presumably from a broken heart and this has a traumatic effect on him as he feels guilty about leaving her and thereby abandons his fathers new family and goes off without telling anyone where he is <0>
there is one scene where ana and him are in the same outdoor cafe in madrid but fail to see each other even though sitting at tables with their backs next to each other which outlines the course fate will take for the two of them <0>
{} after her mothers new marriage to the other alvaro ana becomes the lover of someone she met in that madrid cafe where the fated lovers did not meet ottos elementary school teacher and will live with him for fouryears <0>
she also will become an elementary school teacher as again things are shown to go around in circles <0>
but she leaves her older lover pulled toward finding otto again <0>
and she gets that chance after another coincidence occurs <0>
her new stepfather hooks her up with his father who is the otto that otto was named after and the former german pilot will let her stay in a cabin he owns in finland where she will await for her otto to rescue her from her unhappiness <0>
he is now a maildelivery pilot seen doodling circles on his pilots map while circling around the antarctic circle and is still pining for ana as he suffers from his decision to be alone <0>
his life seems to be damaged by his misunderstandings and miscommunications which have prevented him from being with the one he loves <0>
{} as you might suspect by now this film is not going to be clearly resolved <-1>
why should it be at this point it has teased the audience from the opening scene onward and there is no reason why the ending shouldnt also be speculative <0>
{} ana sends a letter to ottos father a letter that otto actually delivered himself without realizing it was from ana and he reads it when he visits his lonely and aging father to cheer him up <0>
in the letter is the same note that she sent to the teenage otto when she was encouraging him to be her lover and climb through her bedroom window by stating be brave <0>
{} the film will end on two differing versions one is labeled anas eyes and the other otto in anas eyes <0>
in the first version there is a happy ending as otto parachutes to safety on the grounds of anas arctic circle cabin and just misses her but finally comes into her arms in the pilots apartment and supposedly will find some renewed happiness in his life <0>
though even in this type of traditional hollywood ending that has pleased movie goers of romantic films for generations now the director has his doubts if there is any state of being that can be permanent <0>
in the second version there is a sad ending as otto goes to meet ana and sees her crossing the street clutching a newspaper with a picture of a downed plane griefstricken thinking that otto has died and she is hit by a red bus and dies <0>
in the final shot there is a picture of otto in her eyes <0>
which one is the true version probably doesnt matter as the director will allow you to believe whatever you want to <0>
if you are interested in my guess it would be the later version the story seems to flow in that direction <0>
most people i know were put off by this slick ending and question the filmmakers real intentions for playing with the audience like this <0>
as for me it wasnt the ending that bothered me about this breathlessly beautiful film with its stunning shot of the midnight sun and of the arctic wildlands as much as the story getting lost in trying to be too fanciful playing with my expectations for things to work out for these amenable lovers and then not delivering any firm message but what seems to be at first glance only a pretentiously philosophical one <-1>
and by not staying on target with the romantic part of the story but drifting around in circles where the coincidences are just too much for any two people to experience in a lifetime the film becomes marginalized and makes it seem like a philosophy exercise albeit an absorbing one but one that is nevertheless less dramatic and more melodramatic than it should be <-1>
{} but what i found strangely pleasant about the film was that even though i was somewhat put off by the tricks employed throughout the story i still found myself caught up in the dynamics of the characters and how commonplace their lives were that is if you could discount all the chance encounters <1>
this made me realize that it didnt matter if this film wasnt going to meet my expectations about what should be happening or if its philosophy was overtly too oblique the film had a special quality about it that got its message across despite being off target <1>
{} the directors son peru medem otto as a child gave a dreamlike performance as someone who is wrapped up in innocence and desire which is tearing at the fabric of his being and he made the story come to grips with what it was about or should have been about the obsessive love one has for someone a love that is inexplicable and cant be explained away by rationality or palindromes or reflections <2>
victor hugo oliveira as the teenage otto twisted up inside by the strange love relationship he is going through was delivering a sensitive performance as this relationship was intriguing dangerously close to being incestuous but was one that was not clarified any further to the detriment of the film but to no fault of the actor <1>
therefore the startling ending to the film became less important to comprehend because the heart of the film wasnt explored as much as it should have been <-1>
the strangeness of this film is that its haunting use of language and visuals to fill in the blanks for the characters still overshadows its melodramatic story and keeps the pot boiling even when you might think the film is skiing lumberingly uphill instead of gracefully downhill and is about to slip and slide downhill in a crackup <0>
but that never happens because the film has a special elusive quality about it that original films seem to always have <-1>
{} thusly i felt caught up in the films magical spell despite the many reservations i had about the manipulations the director used as he ultimately proved that he has weaved a tale about the darkened lovers and their nearmisses and made it into a tale of haunting characterizations leaving something mysterious about this intangible and intelligent film that held my undivided attention throughout <1>

{} much ado is made about aspidistra in this comedy adapted from the semiautobiographical novel of george orwell <0>
its a hardy houseplant used in the story to connote middleclass london respectability when placed on the windowsill of a flat and in the lowclass lambeth neighborhood it is offered to the impoverished bookstore clerk as a sign of affection by his kindly landlady <0>
the plant acts as a metaphor indicating that the confused young hero of the film cant escape his middleclass destiny <0>
his landlady in his middleclass immaculate flat mrs meakin liz smith is actually the most diverting one in the film her nose lifts upward in snooty sarcasm capturing all you have to know about the direction this film is heading as she reacts to the poets one night drinking binge that got in the papers and got him fired from his hampstead bookstore job and kicked out of mrs meakins flat <0>
the aspidistras in her place seem cold and hostile to the troubled young poet <0>
they show how stuffy and pretentious life is in a suburban neighborhood while in a slum the people have nothing to lose so they are free to speak their mind and social restrictions are not as tensely kept <0>
{} the upperclass are royally seen through the depiction of ravelston wadham a wealthy publisher who has the luxury of having sex in the afternoon with his acidtongued priggish girlfriend vickerage and living a carefree existence in his spacious townhouse <0>
he even considers himself to be a socialist which is ridiculed by his stodgy mannerisms and snobbish attitude <0>
{} theres a point to be made in this s depression satire about money counting for everything and this point is hammered into every aspect of the story until it gets to be not only redundant but outright irritating to hear <-1>
the wouldbe poet gordon comstock grant who is unsatisfied with his success and promotion in an adverting firm where he is writing advertising slogans impulsively quits his job when he gets a good review in a london newspaper for one one of his poetry books published by his friend ravelston <0>
he narcissistically dreams of international fame and entry into the poetry world of auden and t s eliot his girlfriend and coworker rosemary helena bonham carter does the graphic art for his slogans and is happy to be a petitioner of middleclass values which is what her boyfriend tells her he is rejecting <0>
her role in the film is to wait for him to come to his senses and join her willingly in matrimony which he will do after he experiences the harshness of poverty tires of roaming the streets composing banal poems and accepts responsibility for making rosemary pregnant <0>
his boss is erskine jim carter who makes money from gordons wordsmith skills therefore is disappointed that he quit but leaves the job open for him if he wishes to return <0>
{} the story quickly makes its point as valid as it might be in orwells novel here it seems trivial that people delude themselves into thinking that they are the next shakespeare and spend a miserable time living in poverty or doing what they shouldnt be doing when they would be much happier being accepted into the middleclass where they duly belong <0>
its a fair enough point made but the story has this nasty habit of being saccharine to a point where its sugary qualities could be fatal to the viewers heart <-1>
even the scenes of poverty are sugarcoated making everything look so awfully nice <0>
the film shows how foolish the young man was in giving up his career work in which he shows an aptitude for and foolishly chooses something he was not born to do trying to be a william blake who was endowed with a rich poetical imagination therefore could live joyously in an indigent state in lambeth and still be creative <0>
something gordon cant do <0>
it also somehow stretches the point of art and advertisement having much in common cynically stating there is little difference between how they achieve their ends <0>
{} it just became dull watching all the clich about the classes bantered back and forth with the picturesque view of gordon descending into poverty working in a musty lambeth bookstore and the creamy richness of his return to middleclass life when the film ends on a happy note as he returns to his former place of work to cheers from his colleagues and into the warm embraces of his girlfriend and back into the good graces of his stolid middleclass sister harriet and back to his eager boss who is only too glad to hire him again <0>
{} the message i got as i watched this tepid middlebrow socalled art film is that living in poverty can be stifling and that kind of life is not what makes an artist <0>
what the film had to offer was nothing more than seeing a few artists names referred to some inferences that there is a merry war going on between men and women some mild invectives about class differences and all of lifes battle were condensed to being about money matters <0>
for a movie railing against accepting bourgeoisie values it instead becomes a movie that ends up glorifying those values <-1>
its final message is that there is no escape from ones destiny <0>
{} if one looked hard enough there can be found some wit in gordons portrayal of a likable jerk with artistic ambitions and some charm in his relationship with rosemary <1>
but this uninspired script cannot find anything relevant to say to make this satire meaningful <-2>
in fact it makes a mockery of orwells intentions to sympathize with an artist who is prepared to make his own way in the world <0>
orwells down and out in paris and london offers a more interesting take he has on being poor as he worked for a time as a dishwasher and in a hampstead bookstore as a clerk <0>
youll get a better feel of what orwell was trying to satirize reading that book than you will by seeing this film <-1>

{} a zippy youth oriented christmas movie though there is no bing singing white christmas in this one marketed for the druggie generation of postteens and those in their late s that is perhaps a cut above the rest of the mindless offerings flooding the market to capture filmlands largest share of ticket buyers as it tells its somewhat derivative black comic tale pulp fiction type dialogue and style fuelled by the originality of its accelerated pace using the cool lifestyle in lala land as its backdrop and telling about its main characters who either work in a supermarket or are involved small time in using or pushing pills <2>
{} go is made up of three interconnected stories which are told in different versions from the point where ronna polley as the supermarket cashier strapped for rent money about to be evicted on christmas eve is on the phone as her fellow supermarket cashier the britisher simon desmond who needs to go to las vegas with his mates makes ronna an offer giving her his pay up front if she takes his shift at work <0>
{} the first story is about ronna who shows some spunk interacting with her fellow workers by playing a funny kind of guess the celebrity game while on a break but is quickly dislodged into reality when the manager tells her the break is over and she is back at work filling in for simon after finishing her hour shift <0>
in this frenetically paced film the innovative young director doug liman following his indie debut feature swingers shows that he has a feel for these young people and their problematic world as he grapples with their realities giving us a good look at how they view themselves their job and their customers <2>
on ronnas check out line are two goodlooking guys appearing to be swish to the dismay of one of ronnas cashier girlfriends claire katie as these two adam scott wolf and zack jay mohr ask for simon and quickly let on that he is their drug supplier while telling ronna they will deal with her because they need the stuff immediately for a party <0>
this gives ronna some ideas that she can do the deal herself by going to simons supplier todd olyphant but he tells her she needs all the money up front to make the deal <0>
from there on what can go wrong for her does <0>
the most amusing bit is that we see her pushing aspirins and sinus pills as substitutes for the hallucinogenic ectasy pill at a party where those who are there are so high already they dont know the difference from one pill to the other <1>
{} the second story is one that i must have seen a dozen times by now in films about the guys who go to vegas gamble over their head get into trouble have a car chase meet some gangsters and vegas showgirls and have themselves a vacation they cant forget <-1>
what saves this story is not the story but the charm of the hapless simon in vegas and the mood set by the glitzy vegas world of neon that blends violence in with the loud background music as the bouncers chase after simon and his friends all because simon put his hands on a lap dancer and wounded the bouncer who was pummeling him <1>
but it is the very likable nature of simons amusing friends as they chatter away <1>
one conversation has the white tiny breckin telling the black marcus taye that race is a state of mind other conversations include one about tantric sex that saves the day in vegas <0>
{} the third and final story traces adam and zack the two tv actors and lovers who got busted and are now wired to catch other drug offenders such as simon and ronna with the promise by the weird undercover officer in charge of them fichtner that if they cooperate they will be let completely off the hook <0>
i though fichtner was the funniest and most malevolent one in the film <1>
{} i dont think the film had much to say about much of anything including the use of drugs but it hit hard at being an hilarious film with its fastpaced mood swings its sharp editing cuts and frequent light changes allowing its story to be easy to watch and imbuing the characters with a certain attitude about them that made their performances seem eclectic <1>
i especially liked sarah polley when she wasnt on the screen the film seemed to lack purpose <2>
{} in any case go has watch ability because of its raw energy and the way it was able to get inside a pill poppers head and to convey on screen how hallucinatory his world looks when he is high <1>
yet the film for all its innovative features still could not escape from being on the edge of sitcom and not on the edge of innovative filmmaking <-1>
and the only reason for calling it a christmas story is because it happens during the holiday season probably accurately showing how some generation xers now spend their holidays <0>
the films appeal is still mostly with the younger generation <0>
they are the ones who are mostly likely to be amused at how the main characters in the story comport themselves <1>
while the older generations might not be as amused and feel put off by the lack of any character depth or real wit in the story <-1>
and the benign ending not only didnt make sense but seemed artificial and embarrassing to watch <-2>
it was as if this film after using all its energy in rebellion now wants to conform and give the adults a happy ending <-1>

[21168/c]
{} the game is a manipulative but entertaining film that falls far short of director finchers more successful seven <-1>
michael douglas is seen in almost every shot of the film as he plays a part that he can probably do in his sleep that is of a nasty egotistical extremely wealthy white man who has everything that is material that he wants in life and seems invincible until things start to fall apart and he begins to get what is coming to him <0>
{} for his th birthday which he celebrates in his san francisco mansion his goodfornothing younger brother conrad penn gives him a mysterious present called the game which he reluctantly accepts wishing not to offend the giver <0>
a company called consumer recreation service developed the game to imitate whatever it is a person is missing in his life <0>
{} the game takes on dangerous pretensions as douglas wonders if this is really a game or is it to be taken for real or is he just being scammed <0>
his bank account is stolen he is drugged and someone is trying to kill him among the many other things that are now infiltrating his once smug life <0>
yet he is slow to do the obvious which is to call the police or get his own people to take care of the problem a person in his position would not be tackling this by himself <0>
we watch him begin to unravel and you are perhaps feeling like i do at this point of the story that i am being setup following a tale that is so unbelievable that i am being taken for a sucker to buy into this <0>
anyway we are not that concerned about douglas maybe thats because we dont have much to go on why he is as obnoxious and joyless as he is except we learn that his father committed suicide when he was a child and he never quite got over it <0>
he goes through life not understanding why his father did this to him taking the suicide personally <0>
{} the purpose of the film becomes to try and figure out what is going on with this game whether he is in a scam or not and whether this will give him a better understanding of himself and if he can ever learn to trust people <0>
it also portends to be a psychological study of a controlfreak in distress now unable to control his environment <0>
{} the best feature of the film is its unpredictability it is what sucks you into watching the entire film expecting something sensational to take place <0>
i thought any ending would be apt <0>
i never got a sense that what was happening mattered <-1>
and when you become conscious that what is going on is all acting and only acting even if films are just that nevertheless they should hold out the illusion that what is on screen is real and if that is not so then it becomes natural to lose interest in the story and you become prepared to accept whatever it is that you see happening on the screen whatever the director wants to put in any logic will do <0>
{} i felt nothing as i watched to see if douglas will commit suicide or if this is really an onthelevel game or if douglas will be transformed by the game into a better human being which to me would be the phoniest way for this film to end <0>
so when i saw what actually developed i could only think of how clever this filmmaker is that he used the same formula that someone making toothpaste commercials might use to catch the consumers attention <2>
in this case the consumer is the viewer who has no other reference points to find out what is true except what fincher tells them is true <0>
{} art is more metaphorical than that commercial films are not their bottom line is always the almighty dollar and the gimmick that will get it for them <0>
this film should be pleasing to those who like to play games <1>
but the film will only work for those who are willing to believe that they are in nicks shoes and can relate to the choices he makes <-1>
{} the director is a graduate from the video and advertising world well able to work in that slick media market who has come up with a novel idea for a film but one that falls short in being credible <-1>

{} after a brilliant stylish opening sequence this film begins to unravel and by the time it ends it is a misfire <-2>
cage and sinise play well off each other sinise reserved just right for the part cage frenetic over emoting but still very effective <1>
cage is the free spirited corrupt atlantic city cop and childhood friend of sinise who is the naval officer in charge of security for the secretary of defense <0>
{} he is in atlantic city to protect the secretary while he attends the heavyfight fight that turns out to be fixed cage is his guest he is only there to watch the fight but in some ludicrous way becomes in charge of the investigation after the assassination <0>
the assassination taking place in the crowded boxing venue is masterfully done and well worth the price of admission as de palma goes crazy with his cameras offering numerous shots from all different angles of the crowd and the casino <1>
{} we are witnesses to this assassination from many different perspectives <0>
we soon learn who the villains are so the picture that so brilliantly set up an interesting set of conflicts between the characters such as loyalty corruption sense of duty patriotism and ones own personal dilemmas begins to go off in another direction in the direction of where the film makers think it can draw in the box office crowds that is it turns into a flat action movie where things are easily predictable and we are cut off from any emotional involvement with the characters <-1>
{} the camera is the only star of this film <-2>
in the end this became a very annoying picture that promised so much and only delivered what could be best described as superficial entertainment <-2>

{} there must be some unwritten rule that states one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere <0>
in the exotic morocco of a yearold english hippie mother julia winslet of two sweet young girls the yearold lucy carrie and the yearold bea bella has arrived for a years stay with the selfabsorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband she is not officially married to him and her cold oneroom london flat and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech <0>
at least she says she is as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers <0>
she has not planned things out too carefully having no money and the trip doesnt seem like its much fun more like a misadventure with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in <0>
{} drugs a worldwide youthful phenomena during this period where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the good life cheaply and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities even though drugs are illegal there <0>
but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here <0>
in this film the subject of drugs is never broached only hinted at in an offhanded but slurring way as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken <0>
even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons to follow the mystical sufis seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from <0>
{} the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freuds granddaughter esther freud who traveled here in the s with her mother and sister <0>
it is written by the directors brother who has previously directed regeneration the playboys and trojan eddie <0>
{} the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls <0>
{} with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria so instead she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar bilal said taghmaoui <0>
he becomes her lover taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls <0>
the girls readily accept him and there is no bigtodo made about their openly sexual relationship but the girls really dont know what to make of the relationship <0>
it especially bothers bea who is embarrassed by her mothers loose attitude and wants to go home <0>
things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village <0>
it seems only that bilals charm is matched by his shiftlessness as he has a wife who still lives there <0>
this scene didnt make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people also <-1>
but i doubt that <-1>
{} the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel <0>
lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a normal girl <0>
{} the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes expansive views illustrious mosques and grand sunsets <0>
kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences as many a dropout reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose <0>
{} the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film <2>
the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves <0>
{} the familys travel which is on the edge has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting but when she gets up all there is is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her <0>
that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her is starting to wear thin in her thoughts <0>
it will dawn on her when bea takes ill as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence <0>
he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him <0>
the new guru is grounded in reality something she is not grounded in and seems to tell her what she couldnt comprehend from anyone else even comforting her by telling her that her tears are memories a gift from god <0>
{} the films weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia <-2>
the storyline about a helpless single parent detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same babyboom generation had during their trip to morocco who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers contrary to the impression the film might give seemed to pass her by <0>
her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep at best <0>
she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along smoking some hashish and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldnt have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey <0>
after all the mystical trip is the journey <0>
{} the films strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are and no one is that good or that bad or judged too harshly for their shortcomings <2>
bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity <0>
the little girls are precocious but they are lovable <0>
julia the cornerstone the film is built on is a mother who cares about the children but doesnt know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them <0>
she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where shes at <0>
this is a very freudian way to look at things as this sudden realization that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey at least for the time being <0>
and after all is said and done whos to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences just like she probably was <0>

{} stir of echoes is firstly a ghost story and then its a murder story taking place in a working class chicago neighborhood where the neighbors party together and seem to be closeknit and concerned about one another <0>
in either case writerdirector david koepp writer of snake eyes the lost world and director of the trigger effect has come up with an emotionally disturbing film <-1>
{} tom witzky kevin bacon is a telephone lineman and as a hobby plays guitar for a rock band <0>
he is down on himself for his life being so ordinary yet he tells his expectant wife maggie kathryn erbe that he is a happy man because he has her <0>
one of their problems is that their year old son jake zachary david cope sees ghosts and carries out conversations with them in a most peculiar fashion <0>
he asks a ghost does it hurt to be dead <0>
if i were his dad i would have gotten the kid some professional help before i attended another neighborhood get together <0>
{} but this ghost story is about the ordeal of the most unlikely believer in such supernatural tales the hardhat father of jake the one who has always repressed his extraordinary visionary gift <0>
therefore the film chooses not to focus too much on the precocious kids gift going almost exclusively for his fathers nightmarish visions to tell its tale <0>
{} toms common man persona will quickly change during one of those gatherings when his sisterinlaw lisa illeana douglas her sardonic humor much appreciated by me talks about hypnosis and the drunken and skeptical tom challenges the very amateur hypnotist to put him under <1>
as a result the lesson being becomes never play mind games you dont understand with someone inexperienced and not completely reliable who has you under their power <0>
as it turns out our man is a receiver which in the supernatural trade means that he has the gift he could see things in the other world <0>
tom is told to think of an empty theater with that in mind visions come to him very violently of some illdoings in the house he is renting giving him the impression someones buried there <0>
when out of the trance he says he felt no pain and is surprised when told he had a pin stuck in him <0>
he remembers nothing of his visions but still has xray vision and severe headaches and a foreboding fear that he better do something about these visions or else his family will be in danger <0>
the next day when he turns to ask the kooky lisa what she did to him she tells him she only suggested to him that he keep the door open to have an open mind <0>
{} he starts calling in sick to work and his worried wife thinks hes crackingup <0>
and even after he tells her whats going on inside his head she doesnt get it that this could be something requiring professional help she seems to be more concerned that hes used up all his sick days <0>
but the kid understands his father they are now both on the same wavelength and hold frequent chats together in private afraid that what they are talking about would scare mommy <0>
{} tom is now obsessed with the vision of a ghost in the house which he soon identifies as a missing neighborhood teenager samantha kozac jenny <0>
she is mentally retarded and the sister of debbie liza weil who babysits for jake for only the first time at the suggestion of jake <0>
debbies presence gets the ghost story really rolling as jake blurts out to her his visions of samantha being in the house <0>
though at times the story is close to losing it getting enveloped in melodramatics it manages to pull back and return to the family and their struggle with the existence of a ghost in their house and their marital problems keeping the film suspenseful allowing you to overlook if you care to the many holes in the story <1>
it isnt until the climax that the film really falls apart and reverts to a conventional ending as it tries to do justice to the murdered ghost <0>
the film just lost control of what it had going for it that made it different from lets say another recent ghost film the sixth sense and plummeted it back into the world of the runofthe mill films of that genre <-1>
{} when both father and son share ghostly visions of samantha and the film moves into the afterworld to tell its chilling story the tale is compelling <1>
it is illustriously shot and its ghostly visions are stunningly creepy <1>
it also captures in its sights the good bad and ugly of chicago <0>
this fast moving film has hooked onto the nuances of its working class neighborhood completely and by being grounded with this kind of reality the ghost story becomes more effective <1>
{} from this character driven film we learn that ghosts get angry when we dont respond to them properly <0>
that the afterworld is a place that some of us more than others have a chance to penetrate and if we do we better learn how to listen <0>
kevin bacon plays the role convincingly with just the right amount of skepticism and psychological tension coming close but never going over the top like a lesser actor might have been tempted to do <1>
kathryn erbe is solid in her role as the loving wife who doesnt see what the rest of her family sees supernaturally but in her own brave way tries to manage to keep the family together <1>
zachary david cope seems like a child who is used to seeing strange things all his life and is rather placid and accepting about it playing his role as well as could be expected <1>
but i did have some problems that what was happening to him was not more fully developed <-1>
i felt i didnt really know much more about him by the films end than from its beginning <-1>
in both sequences ghosts are communicating with him <0>
i just had the feeling that the kid could end up being a basket case if his folks didnt take some time to help him deal with his gift and that even though they were hard working and nice people they were not a very perceptive couple <-1>
{} what transpires is an ok ghost story a suspenseful story of an ordinary couple trying to cope with something that they are not prepared for and a weak murder story that ruins the film as it brings it down to earth in a most desultory manner <-1>
{} is the film worth seeing <0>
yes <1>
it is entertaining and spooky and you get taken on an emotional roller coaster ride <1>
no <-1>
it is earthbound and contrived and the ending is a stinker <-1>
take your pick both answers are correct <0>

{} there is no question that one has to be careful about the good taste required when making a socalled comedy film about the holocaust not to offend those who have suffered enough already but that proves to be no problem here as benigni went to some jewish organizations prior to shooting the film and got their blessings for this project <2>
besides i dont think there are any sacred subjects that cant be touched it is ultimately the quality of the film itself that counts <1>
and if there is another reason for not disapproving offhand the films comic handling of this horrific context then lets bring up the example of charlie chaplin in the the great dictator though not directly about the holocaust nevertheless it was a light comedic parody of the fuehrer and it was considered by many not only to be an appropriate film but one of the all time great films <1>
the later part of the assessment of that film is in recognition of that films tremendous power to satirize nazism <0>
benignis film just cant muster that same power because it has muddled and sanitized its telling of the story too much as wellintentioned as he might have been in trying to tell the story the power in the telling of it is just not there <-1>
what is there are bits and pieces of the holocausts human story that is as horrific a story as any one can imagine and offers some contribution to understanding the affects of the holocaust <1>
what he just doesnt make clear is that the italian fascists were part of the final solution <-1>
they were not joking around about killing jews <0>
the proof is the large number of italian jews who were killed in the holocaust <0>
benignis film offers no explanation for this <-1>
a much better and truer film than his that unfailingly tells about the italian culpability in the holocaust is the garden of the finzicontinis which didnt waste the audiences time trying to amuse them with childish antics instead stayed true to what was happening to the jewish families in italy <-1>
{} life is beautiful is the line trotsky said before he was about to be assassinated serves as the rosy title for such a downbeat subject that is played in a hearfelt and sincere manner even though what it offers for nazi atrocities is for the most part the mildly antiseptic kind reminding me of stalag or hogans heroes tv series where the nazis are pictured as cartoon buffoons <1>
{} having a horse painted green marked as a jewish horse makes for a colorful scene and segue to elopement for guido benigni and dora braschi but in no way begins to symbolize or explore the deep rooted hatred that would lead to a policy of genocide <0>
to find such truths go way beyond the scope of this comedy star vehicle which instead uses this serious subject matter for benigni to contrast his charlie chaplin like routines with the threat of genocide that is ominous while following a story line that will not try to offend anyone probably not even the nazis that much especially since benigni calls this story a fable giving him an excuse to invent what he wants for the film <0>
let me tell you the holocaust was no fable <0>
but yet because the subject matter is so deadly serious he is at least able to reach a more general audience drawn to see such a film they would have most likely not seen but see it because of benignis comic ability and in the process he has vouchsafed for them how insane the worlds prejudice against jews has been as he makes the films efforts seem worthy enough even if that were all this film would accomplish that would be plenty <1>
but i believe he does accomplish more but he does it by distorting history until in the end he does show the horror and tragedy of the holocaust in his own inimical way <-1>
{} in the first part of the film if you did not know that benignis guido was jewish you certainly couldnt tell since he just seemed like he was an eccentric motormouth italian <0>
so in that sense this film in a roundabout way is erasing that stereotyped prejudice some people might still have about jews being so different from others <1>
{} i was not offended by seeing comedy routines take place in a concentration camp i also was not touched as i should have been with the gravity of the situation due to the comic effects <-1>
and if any one in their right mind thought that by playing some silly child game in a concentration camp they could survive i got a surprise for them it aint so <-1>
{} the book that gave me a very truthful and precisely frank look at the daily lives of those in such predicaments is the one by the italian chemist and former concentration survivor primo levi whose autobiographical i survived auschwitz shows what it really was like in those camps <0>
that book touched me even more than the truest film to date that i saw about the holocaust shoah did <-1>
after you read that book there can be no illusions that you are in for a game in the park when you are interred in such a camp <-1>
though the italian jews had it easier than the others brought to the camp because they came there pretty near the end of the war and therefore were not subjected to long torturous years of suffering nevertheless it was a place where the survivors looked like skeletons and felt as if they were already dead <-1>
{} the film is really made up of two parts each with a very different feel to it <0>
the first part consists of lushly created cinematography as it tells of the clownish hyper antics of guido as he is an italian country boy coming to the tuscan city in a brakeless car where he is mistaken for the italian king as he whizzes by a crowd awaiting the king holding his arm out accidently in a nazi salute to keep the crowd away this is in <0>
for most of this part of the film we dont even know if he is jewish until we see the green horse and later on see the sign on his bookstore saying this is a jewish place since he seems to be in some denial mode of what is really going on around him <0>
{} amid a whole bag full of slapstick jokes which probably never go out of style since the audience where i watched the film howled with uncontrollable laughter at all the corny bits leaving me to wonder why i cant muster a laugh <-1>
there must be something funny about this physical humor after all there is a long line of vaudeville comedians who made people laugh for generations doing those schticks <-1>
i guess this kind of comedy is just not my cup of tea and if others find it funny and because of it find the film endearing then it is just a question of differing tastes <-1>
though quite frankly i did think most of the bits were embarrassingly crass for instance those contrived scenes where he keeps bumping into his future wife and the switching of hats and the egg in the face routine i found to be especially tedious since i find him to be more energetic and a master of good timing than outright funny <-2>
but i also must say the first part of the film was easy to watch it seemed to have a smooth and even flow to it <1>
{} guido immediately finds romance with the wealthy school teacher dora who is his reallife wife <0>
its too bad she cant act but then again this is basically a one man show so really she just becomes another one of his props much like a leading lady in a marx bros movie is used as a diversion to balance their comedy routines <1>
guidos romance is complicated by doras engagement to a local fascist bureaucrat which gives guido a chance to pull every string in our hearts as he goes about winning her love from the typical comedy film foil her buffoonlike fascist lover plays <0>
this material is shamelessly old hat it is only effusive because the star is so frenetic and nimble and manipulative on screen <2>
but there were also some clever bits like his speech though not original it still hit the mark as he pretended to be a school official giving a talk on racial superiority to elementary students where dora teaches using his body as an example of all his superior fascist parts such as his belly button which is a good fascist one <1>
guido does this while working for his uncle as a waiter <0>
{} when the scene changes from the greenhouse he enters with dora after their elopement and it is now and he is happily married to her the tragedy of their situation finally hits home and part two of the film turns grim as the loving father of a fiveyearold is arrested by the fascists and along with his son is taken cattlestyle by train to the camp <0>
his wife who is not jewish is not arrested but she insists on going to the camp with them <0>
in order for the father to allay the childs fears he says its all a game and who ever scores points will win a tank a real one <0>
this prize is valuable to the kid whose favorite possession at home is his toy tank <0>
this game idea could probably work for as long as a train ride from italy to germany but for anyone to think it could work inside the camp that would be ludicrous on their part to think so <-1>
the camp they were in seemed more as if it were a coal mine then a death camp and guido was stuck with a bad coal miners job with really rotten bosses and working conditions <0>
the jews in the camp looked so well fed that it was hard to believe that they were in a concentration camp <-1>
{} the kid was perky and wideeyed and intelligently precocious just right for the part and the only other person who caught my attention in a multidimensional performance where you could at least find some variable expressions on their face was horst bucholz as a nazi doctor who was waited on by guido in his uncles restaurant and is now a doctor in the camp insensitive to guidos new position in life but still showed enough cognition for him to save his life by making him a waiter in the camp <1>
everyone else said their lines in a flat monotone voice that projected bad acting and because of that almost made a mockery out of their roles <-2>
naturally the comedy routines did not work inside the camp except for the bit where guido translates the rules of the camp for the german guards as he makes it seem to the kid that what he is reading are the rules for the game they are playing as he explains that the guards are only acting mean because they are part of the game <0>
no one laughed in the audience but this was funny in a way that you wouldnt laugh out loud funny <1>
some slapstick was tried such as guidos comically high stepping walk but that got no laughs <0>
but mostly for this part of the film the emphasis became on this game he was playing for his kids sake his love was so great for him that he would do anything to save his life <0>
audiences could relate to that and that cleverly became the focal and selling point of the film <1>
that is primarily why this film won an oscar for best foreign film its comedy alone would not have been enough <1>
{} the film to its ever lasting credit was able to clearly depict jews as human beings not as objects to be reduced to soap or buttons more human than the nazis who have disqualified themselves from being a civilized regime by their inhumanity <1>
this leaves the masterminds of racial superiority with their own absurd philosophies of intolerance <1>
{} where i think life is beautful succeeded most is being a film that inadvertly without probably really being fully aware of what it was doing showed how unprepared the jews were for this tragedy by being in a state of denial <1>
after the holocaust the rallying motto of the surviving jews was never again <0>
and what they learned from this event in history is to be vigilant and not be in a state of denial about prejudice ever again <0>
which is one of the reasons why the holocaust is such a touchy subject and one has to be careful about how one presents it to others lest one forgets its dire consequences <0>
and as unbelievable as it may seem life is beautful somehow or other caught an interesting aspect of the holocaust with an original take on how passive the jews were something few films really make a major point of for one reason or another <1>
most italian jews stayed put in their home country until the moment was too late for them to leave never believing that the absurd philosophy of the nazis could be taken seriously <0>
guido at this time is in the bourgeoisie social strata being a bookseller not wanting to give up on his country while at the same time frame primo levi was an italian resistance fighter captured and sent to the camp <0>
{} did the film do enough to show the horrors of genocide <0>
for some people it evidently did enough to leave them beguiled by the improbable mix of comedy and a holocaust <-1>
the uniqueness and likability of this film is that benigni exploits his comic talents to take advantage of a very difficult situation using comedy as a weapon <1>
but this is most definetly an example of the rewriting of history by seeing the holocaust as if it could almost be perceived as comical and not quite real as a fable depending on the audience itself to know fully well what happened where only by the very end of the film is there a realization that something terrible has happened and a tear could be shed does a disservice to how history and the victims of it look at it and fails to recognize how little people not directly involved with the holocaust actually know about it <-1>
{} there is a reason why films are popular and that reason is that people want to see what they like on screen they as a rule do not like to think about things that are unpleasant to them and this film has deftly and arbitrarily accomplished that by skimming the surface off all the horrible things they could have seen instead it subtly goes about its business by hiding from the audience what really happened to the jews in those camps by not showing how real their plight was <-1>
this film seemed almost like it was primarily a very personal film about a fathers love for his family and his great sacrifice for them rather than a holocaust film per se <-1>
{} that the world is still filled with hatred filled with other genocide campaigns and not filled with enough people throughout the world with enough courage to put a stop to this attitude is as plain as day <0>
i still think that most of the world is at a low stage of the evolutionary scale and ready to do a nazistyle thing all over if given the chance just check out the recent serbiankosovo conflict for affirmation that ethnic cleansing has not gone away with the end of nazism <0>
{} so what can a film do <0>
probably all it can do is show what really happened and it doesnt matter if its method is drama comedy or even a musical as long as it is meaningful <0>
i intend to be very critically tolerant of this film and say that even though it struck me as a rather thin holocaust story it is still a worthwhile film for those who dont want or cant handle the heavier stuff and are not put off by the comedy <-1>
they will find if they look hard enough and look past what miramax promoted for its own purposes so it could win the oscar a film that is more complex than it appears at first glance <1>
but they will also find that it is a film that still makes it evident that the world still is in denial of what really happened and can only look at the holocaust in a rather superficial way even after all these years <-1>
there is still an element of world guilt that because of that will so highly reward this film with honors even if the film has shown that it cannot open up both its eyes to see how real the holocaust was <-1>
but i guess we should thank benigni for at least opening up one eye and letting us see that both his films take on the holocaust and most of the worlds take on the holocaust is still bonded by denial about how they view the holocaust which is the same mistake the italian jews made when they denied the obvious what was right in front of their noses until it was too late <-1>

{} an autobiographical film of hou hsiao hsien grounded in the history of taiwan from through the s and the early s <0>
this was a very demanding and taxing film for me to follow not because of its slow pace and lack of action scenes but because i didnt have a full knowledge of what taiwan was historically undergoing during that time frame therefore the many innuendoes and references to past events didnt always connect with me as well as it should have <-1>
i could only watch the film from the point of view of what i got from the film itself <0>
and that is the story of a family trying to cope with their own secrets and their own idiosyncrasies that proves to be a very human tale something along the lines of an ozu film <0>
{} the family leaves the mainland of china in and settles in taiwan where the father who remains aloof from running the family business leaving all that to his wife as he concentrates on his job in a school <0>
he gives his wife most of the salary and she uses it to take care of their big family which includes the elderly grandmother <0>
ahha is the child who seems to miss having a father around the most <0>
he is seen as being rebellious as a child often disciplined by his mother <0>
but he is also shown acting like a typical child playing games and running around with the other children enjoying a rich childhood growing up with many pleasant memories <0>
he is deeply loved by his grandmother who tells him stories about the mainland and their ancestors telling him her wish to return there something he doesnt follow especially since he feels perfectly at home in taiwan <0>
{} when he becomes a teenager he hangs around with a street gang <0>
as a result he does not distinguish himself in school until he realizes that he will have to pass the exams and choose a career or else he will have a tough time surviving in taiwan <0>
he is also attracted to a girl who wants him to go to the university which stimulates him further to pass the exams <0>
his older sister is the more dominant one in the family but we see him growing more and more loyal to the family especially when his father dies and then when his mother dies he is deeply shaken showing the great love he had for her <0>
the film is shot through the point of view of ahha <0>
{} what is beautiful about the film is its lushness the sunny colors it evokes giving it a strange sense of touching down on a paradise and the small matters that are very human that it pays very close attention to like the softness of the rain falling his father sitting so nobly by his desk grandmother acting so eccentric and being loved by the family for what she is <1>
when ahha reads the letters of his mother and realizes that the father remained distant from the family because he had tuberculosis and was constantly sick not wanting to contaminate the rest of the family a condition that he didnt tell his wife about before they were married much to her displeasure causing her to remark later on to the family that health might be the only thing that is real he begins to understand his father and the family he was brought up in perhaps for the first time in his life <0>
it is amusing to hear in the letters that he reads after his parents are dead how his father made the family buy bamboo furniture because he always thought the move away from the mainland was a temporary one and that someday they would go home again and it would be no problem discarding the cheap furniture <1>
{} this is a very subtle and wonderfully crafted film that depicts childhood in a very simple but relevant manner that only a very few filmmakers have been able to do in such a sentimental but unsentimental way <1>
this is a work of considerable merit <2>

[17109/a+]
{} tarkovsky in his book sculpting in time mentions that he wanted to make a film about russian nostalgia about that state of mind peculiar to our nation which affects russians who are far from their native land <0>
i wanted the film to be about the fatal attachment of russians to their national roots an attachment which they will carry with them for their entire lives regardless of where destiny may fling them <0>
how could i have imagined as i was making this film that the stifling sense of longing that fills the screen was to become my lot for the rest of my life that from now until the end of my days i would bear the painful malady within myself <0>
{} for that reason seeing how the filmmaker himself was pleased with the film and considered it so important to himself and because of the power and perfection of craft the film exhibited it makes it that much easier for me to say that this film ranks as one of his best works an intriguing masterpiece that is equal to if not better than his other masterpieces solaris andrei rublyov the sacrifice and mirror <2>
{} this is the tale and it seems almost unreal and dreamlike at times of a russian poet oleg who is on assignment in italys tuscany area to write a book about an obscure th century russian composer sosnovsky who studied music in bologna <0>
his landowner sent him there because he believed he was immensely talented <0>
he was able to live in italy for awhile composing but he soon returned to russia voluntarily to face enslavement as a serf evidently feeling that he would rather be a slave in the country he loved than a free man in a country he did not understand <0>
something must have gone wrong because soon after his return he hung himself <0>
how to understand that is puzzling to oleg who is deeply plagued himself with family problems and deeply ensconced in a brooding type of meditation definetly not buddhistlike that leaves him in a state of disorientation as he tries to discover who he is <0>
{} the film opens in a deep fog as he and his rubenesque italian translator giordano drive in the sloping mountaneous terrain to visit one of the shrines that mostly women tourists visit when they pray here to the virgin mary <0>
this opening scene is shot in black and white until the translator enters the church and then it is shot in a magnificent sepia and pastel coloring <0>
the visual images of all the scarved peasant ladies with lit candles and starlings coming out of the virgins body are indeed startling <0>
tarkovsky will use the black and white shots again in the film when he is using flashbacks to show that he is dreaming or reflecting back on the events in his life <0>
{} the first impression one gets is that he is having an affair with his translator but that is not the case he is so obsessed with his thoughts that he has difficulty communicating with her which is frustrating for her as she expects something to happen between them and when nothing happens blames it on her poor luck of always choosing the wrong man <0>
the mood of the film is gloomy when a laugh is heard or someone does something silly it is monumental and takes on an unreal scope <0>
the feeling one gets is somewhat as if a child saddened by the outside world is nevertheless able to laugh at something he makes up and thereby feels good about himself <0>
when giordano is asked by the sacristan whether she has come to pray to have a child or to not have one she says she is just looking <0>
the sacristans response is what are you here for then <0>
the implication being that a womans duty is to raise kids <0>
but what is even eerier than her evasive response is that oleg who insisted on coming here chooses not to even go inside the church <0>
it would seem that he is making a statement to the effect that he suddenly realizes amidst such a religious setting that what he wants to find is not outside of himself that he cannot be a tourist anymore he must look inside himself to find what he is looking for <0>
{} he meets his kindred spirit in a madman a former math teacher erland with gloom and doom prophesies for the world who locks his family in the house for seven years for their own safety before someone breaks the door down and they escape and as one guest in the luxurious hotel oleg is staying at says the child runs out of there like a rat from his cage <0>
these two hit it off they see something in each other that is akin in spirit <0>
at first erland is reluctant to talk about what he did but when oleg pursues him to his house which is damaged and flooded from a leaky roof their conversation becomes surreal as both recognize in each other that they are possessed to do what it is they seem compelled to do and nothing can stop them <0>
when erland gives a prophetic speech in rome and then torches himself to death to the accompaniment of music as his parishoners stand impassively by and only his dog shows feelings for what is happening to him we are struck with feelings of empathy and wonder about someone who is so sensitive yet is not sensitive enough to function in a world that is so apathetic to the sufferings in others <1>
his suicide is a harsh opinion on orthodox religions failing role in getting him to alleviate that suffering and how it is quite necessary that we learn ourselves how to humble ourself before we relate to god otherwise there can be no proper cure for our disease <1>
{} the best and truest lines in the film are spoken by the madman <2>
the poet is inarticulate taken aback by his memories and loss of spirit <0>
all the other people he meets on this journey he forms only an allegorical relationship with whether its the translator or churchmen or hotel guests or the italian workers they all have little to say to him <0>
the people are much like the weathermen who can give you the temperature but are lost when the conversation takes a deeper turn they are simply not prepared to talk about what they do not comprehend <0>
for tarkovsky this film is a lifetime journey made by someone who is in pain and must see this pain through for what it is because there is no going ahead without taking this pain with him <0>
he must also be prepared to take care of his spiritual obligations <0>
since tarkovsky for all intensive purposes is a projection at least for this film of oleg as he envisions his life passing before him and is in anguish as he sees his faith being tested and as he starts to take hold of his fragile life maybe for the first time in his long life he seems like a changed person who recognizes his melancholy to be a death wish something that poetically inspires him something that is necessary <1>
{} things do not seem so foreign to him anymore <0>
he knows now that he can travel anywhere in the world without a translator as he lights the candles in the holy water at the hotel and carries out the promise he made to erland when they conversed in his house <0>
the flames are important reminders to him about what he must do to cleanse himself as he takes the lit candles over the baths in his cupped hands he believes they can burn away the core of the material world and give him hope for purity and an eternal life <0>
the film ends in light as through the open circular window of a ruined church the sun shines in and metaphorically erlands house is transposed in it symbolizing his divided state <0>
and as oleg begins to meditatively see who he is inside these literary structures he realizes that he is whole again and that he will return to his native russia that he loves so dearly that is inside his blood and he knows for certain now that it will be there for him forever wherever he goes <0>

[21732/b]
{} this is a film about secrets some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl frances boyd ashley <0>
others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple geoffrey gaines stephen ramsey the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field and his artist wife lillian miriam healylouie who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work <0>
and still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line <0>
{} receiving a summer grant to study chemoelectric therapy geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together as their threeyear marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her <0>
he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab which is off limits to her as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses <0>
his main argument is that this is what the public wants they dont want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments they just want the benefits of science <0>
{} that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster much like frankenstein was created is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science science as a business as opposed to the good science science that cares about the small farmer which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman alex vine david a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming <0>
he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming methods that have just come about in the last thirty years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins <0>
{} the third view in all this is the artists represented by lillian who points out that the artists work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly why shouldnt the same be true of the scientist <0>
she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public questioning what is good or evil in society something that bad science has completely ignored <0>
{} geoffrey impatient to get ahead with his research feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on as he contacts one of the companys higher ups to argue his case but decides he cant wait any longer for their help so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester the gorgeous pet dog of frances a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life <0>
while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car he is spotted by alex and one of his coworkers and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife afraid that alex will spot what he is doing as he rushes away from the area <0>
{} in the dinner scene that was unfortunately flatly done but was nevertheless the heart of the film as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything <-1>
the scientists engage in a rational argument highlighting their different points of view while lillian reacts in an emotional way siding mostly with davids view but coming at it from a much different angle <0>
it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies <-2>
that the directors point of view is absolutely right is beside the point <0>
the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became onedimensional characters <-2>
geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster alex vine was likened to his last name the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art the inspiration for goodness and beauty <0>
{} alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alexs apartment <0>
geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him <0>
the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely <0>
{} the dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it and mercifully the dog dies <0>
the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage but she also fails to respond to davids loving gesture for her to stay with him instead opting to head back to the city <0>
the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientists lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higherups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way <0>
{} what is progress <0>
what can one expect out of life <0>
is the small farmer about to become extinct <0>
{} the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way <0>
{} that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions leaving no room for deeper arguments is the shame of this decent and smart film that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white <-2>
no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic <-1>
there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me as i dont like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically <0>
that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit that inspite of its shortcomings it was worth seeing because of its visual statements though they were also not too subtle they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference <2>
the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high <0>
{} perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene <0>
it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picassos guernica had for him <0>
both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on <0>
{} the pain that lillian feels as she forgets about her desires to raise a family and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song make the world go away blares out from the background after she has learned that frances beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband all in the name of science had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science <0>
{} perhaps the most pertinent question the film asks requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business as the question becomes can science be happily married with art <0>

[17192/b]
{} keitel if you stretch your gullability a bit is a great american film director returning to his native greece after years in the states <0>
his controversial films receive high praise or condemnation from the crowds as this visually stunning film powerfully opens with keitel returning to the small village he was born in as its faceless people dressed in black come out in the open market at night to see a showing of his film in the rain now thats a real homage to films <0>
there are also ominous riot police controlling the crowd in fully armed gear <0>
keitels purpose for being there is twofold he is on a journey a la ulysses to reconstruct his past and he is also anxious to see if he can recover lost reels from the manakia brothers they were the first ones to shoot a film in greece <0>
what fascinates him is that they saw the century come in with its hopes and aspirations they were not politically motivated but were interested in recording what went on with the people and the times they lived in what was right and wrong about those times regardless of the mess that resulted from the mistakes the politicians made <0>
{} this is an ostentacious and mesmerizing film about a film directors obsession with the importance film plays in recording history <0>
it is also a film that is bleak and despairing as it goes on its long and weary journey over hostile territories where governments could never be anything but inhumane and where revolutions were betrayed and costly <0>
what lingers on are the lasting images of isolated places that find in the silence of the landscape a chilling insanity of how cold the world can be <0>
keitel leaves greece for albania crossing the border in a taxi taking along an old lady who has not seen her sister for years because of the war leaving her off in the most somber of albanian towns where she is alone to take in the grimness of the moment looking up at the cold buildings and deathlike quality to life as we leave her with a look of desperation on her face <0>
{} erland josephson plays many different roles as the actress who befriends keitel on his way out of albania and into bucharest in quest of the missing reels <0>
in one of her roles she plays his mother as the mother would be in adjusting to life in war torn europe <0>
this allows us to see what the director saw as a child <0>
again it is a homage to how important it is to record history so that it cannot be forgotten <0>
{} the journey takes him to macedonia bulgaria belgrade and sarajevo <0>
this allows for the film to wax poetic to become a meditation on the landscape to indulge our sense of the incomprehensible as we see what the filmmaker is seeing we all become foreigners in this eeriness in this lost century where the truth has been maimed <0>
{} its images are always powerful even if the dialogue seems superfluous and banal <1>
sarajevo in the middle of the crazy ethnic cleansing war is an inhabitable place where snipers shoot at anything that moves <0>
it is starkly photographed in the fog and in the rubble torn buildings where the people barely exist as they remain there hoping for miracles to get them by <0>
we watch them rejoice in the welcomed fog that is welcomed because the snipers must stop shooting till it clears <0>
the fog is the only place normalcy is allowed to be and even here the dangers are always in the background <0>
that is the message delivered from this politically motivated and visually aesthetic film full of emotion and bereavement for what could have been but is now ruined by blind hatred <1>
the film is tiresome at times too cliche ridden for the potent message it delivers for it be as great as its cinematography is <-1>

{} the shochiku kamata studio specialized in nonsense comedies something the great director one of the worlds most acclaimed yasujiro ozu the tokyo storylate springfloating weeds was keen on doing during this period of his film career when he refused to make talkies until yielding in but continued to make silent social comedies somewhat in the style and equal to in quality to the charlie chaplin and buster keaton films though ozus films were seen through the eyes of children rather than taken from the adults point of view <0>
they were ably coscripted by the master of the nonsense film akira fushimi <0>
in i was born but a film with lots of sightgags made as a social comedy turning darker as the story got a bit more involved with the patriarch of the family mr yoshii tatsuo saito <0>
this splendid example of a salarymans film is the first great film of the masters with many others to follow <2>
it is a film about the lowermiddleclass shomingeki and it takes the form of a domestic drama something ozu continued turning out for his entire film career which spanned from <0>
this lifelong bachelor ironically making family dramas passed away at the early age of <0>
{} the depression came to japan in and continued into the s <0>
by unemployed workers was a salaryman as the banking system crashed <0>
haunted by the fear of unemployment the japanese worker was a subservient figure something that ozu uses in this film to exploit his comedy and satire of the human condition and comment on the pecking order of society where the rich remain in power no matter what <0>
{} the yoshii family moves to the tokyo suburbs which places the lowly clerk near the residence of his boss mr iwasaki takeshi sakamoto which draws comments from yoshiis fellow clerks how he moved there to ingratiate himself further with the boss <0>
the two yoshii sons the ten year old hideo sugawara and the eight year old tokkan kozo have a tough time fitting in with the other kids in the neighborhood who pick on these newcomers <0>
among the group is the bosss son taro kato and the big bully of the group keiji aoki <0>
there is a comic sandal fight among the boys which brings out the films visual humor from the way the framing of the shots magnifies the synchronized reactions of the two fighters <0>
the bully takes away the puzzlering from the little brother but is baffled how to work it <0>
the group scares the brothers so much that on the first day of school for the new students they play hooky <0>
since their father gave them a stern pep talk expecting them to get an e on their work with that letter standing for excellence the boys feel obligated to paint a picture to show their dad what they did in school <0>
but they do not feel capable of imitating how a teacher makes an e so they get a parked beerdelivery trucks young adult driver to forge the grade <0>
he slyly puts an f there and smiles as he leaves the students unaware of what he did <0>
before arriving home the father runs into the older boys teacher who acts concerned why the children didnt show up for school <0>
this results in a lecture by the father that he wants his sons to attend school and grow up to be great men and after being told the reason why the boys skipped school he tells them that if the gang bothers them again just ignore them and they will go away <0>
the boys are not satisfied with this answer but still look up to their father <0>
in fact ozus camera angles for adults when talking to children are always taken from a higher elevation so that the adults are talking down to the children always in a position of superiority <0>
{} the older brother is the braver and more cunning one and when he is again confronted by the hostile boys he realizes that today is payday for his father and his mother mitsuko can afford to buy some beer for her husband <0>
he tells the delivery man about this who becomes very pleased with the boys after the boys mother bought six bottles of beer from him <0>
so when the older brother asks him as a favor to them if he can beat up the bully he obliges them sending the bully home crying <0>
but when he is asked to also beat up the bosss son he tells them no <0>
his family buys more beer than yours <0>
{} the boys when they return to school the next day under the watchful gaze of their father find themselves being accepted by the group <0>
ozu draws the analogy of the workplace power structure to the way children naturally socialize and states that the adults power is vindictively social derived from ones station in life and how much money one has <0>
later on the children are seen playing games together and the brothers prove to be good at also being bullies and are telling the other children that their father is greater than anyone elses <0>
the game they play is a mock power game of killing by giving one the evil eye and the other falls down pretending to be dead <0>
they also comically cross themselves in a parody of christian ritual <0>
but when yoshii comes on the scene and sees taro lying on the ground he quickly picks him up and brushes him off to the disappointment of the boys <0>
{} the question of submission becomes the motif of the film as yoshii is seen by the boys bowing to taros father and they dont understand this <0>
for them taro is not as smart or as strong as they are so why should their father submit to his father if he is the greater man <0>
{} that yoshii was an inferior man was made clear to the adults in the audience from the first scene on where he is humiliated that his truck got stuck in the mud and the boys have to push him out <0>
and that before he even gets settled into his new house he runs over to his boss house and kowtows to him <0>
{} the film shifts gears and the comedy now becomes dark as yoshii is at the boss house watching home movies and the boys are also there as guests of taro and what they see results in their loss of innocence <0>
the home movies become unbearably embarrassing to watch for yoshii and the children as yoshii acts the part of the clown in them and is seen as an obviously inferior man than his boss <0>
he is seen looking up to the boss all the time and performing in order to please the boss <0>
yoshii himself is embarrassed that he has to lower himself so much but he is secretly pleased that he is so successful as a clown and can make everybody laugh <0>
in the house while watching the movie he is doing what he did on film rushing to light the bosss cigarette and trying to ingratiate himself to the boss in anyway he can <0>
taros only comment is your father is really funny <0>
but the boys cant take being in the same room with their father anymore and run out of the house <0>
ozu other purpose of showing the home film being always the gagman it also gives him a chance to parody his own way of shooting films by having the home movie filmed in the same style he uses for this movie such as by using the same tracking shots and camera height angles <0>
he even has some of the bosss other guests yawning at parts of the movie where he shows boats and cars <0>
{} back in the house the boys throw a tantrum as they react to their fathers answers to their constant barrage of questions they hurl at him <0>
asking him why does he bow to the boss <0>
the wry salaryman responds if i didnt i wouldnt get paid and you wouldnt eat <0>
ozus implications are clearly centered around the social use of power comparing the boys rise in stature into the neighborhood group of boys as being determined by who is tougher and smarter <0>
the boys illusion is that all power can be won through ones talents <0>
but in the business world the boss doesnt have to possess those character traits he is the boss because that is the way society is structured and it pays to submit to that hierarchy or else you will be left out in the cold to fend for yourself <0>
{} the childish reaction of the boys to all this is that they decide not to eat anymore <0>
here the mother takes over the next day and cooks up some delicious looking rice cakes for the boys to eat which they eventually will and their father casually joins them and there are no more pretences about who he is as they eat and talk in a natural manner <0>
when the father encourages them to keep going to school to try to become great people he also asks the younger one what he wants to become and he says a lieutenant general <0>
the father then says why not a general and he responds because my brother will be the general <0>
and things seem to be back in order everyone knows their place in life and the sham of the father having to be regarded as a great person is no longer carried out <0>
the relationship is now an honest one after the healing process is completed <0>
the but in the films title comes into place as it indicates that everyone is born equal but that changes soon enough <0>
there is always something to disturb the stability assumed from the outset <0>
ozu affirms the necessity of the family sticking together to face these social challenges as the best chance everyone has of making it successfully through life <0>
{} the only time we see the father and mother talking seriously together is after the children throw their tantrum and she tells the disconsolate husband i hope the boys have a better life than we did and he takes out a bottle of whiskey prepared to drown out his shame and low conception of himself with forgetfulness as he pragmatically responds theyll have to live with it all their lives <0>
when he and his wife check in on the sleeping brothers they ask aloud will they lead the same kind of miserable lives we have <0>
it is now clear that yoshii grovels because he cant do anything else about it <0>
and like many parents in america he only wishes his children have a better life than he does which draws him closer to the audience and presents him in a more sympathetic light <1>
{} in the closing scene after the reconciliation is made among the boys and the father the boys tell taro that his father is the greatest and now encourage their father to bow to taros father <0>
and to further emphasize the pecking order that exists and is realized by the no longer innocent boys the bully rushes down the street to make sure the teacher sees him doff his cap <0>
the plot of the film is encompassed within a short fiveday period and it parallels in a didactic way the social structure of the children and the grownups and how in each group adjustments have to be made in order to survive with the majority of the film being concerned about how the boys start growing up <0>
the adult world is mainly used as a expansion of the boys limited horizons <0>

{} phillip winter vogler plays a soundman who travels by car to lisbon to work on a silent film of the director friedrich monroe bauchau <0>
because of car problems he arrives late and monroe cant be found <0>
phillip takes it on himself to continue working on the film while falling in love with a sensual singer teresa who is the lead singer for the group madredeus <0>
he then goes touring lisbon with some of the kids working on monroes film <0>
the kids fool around with their cameras taking pictures of everything that catches their fancy as he starts putting together the directors unfinished work while he makes himself at home in the directors unique apartment <0>
while winter is cruising lisbon in search of sounds to match friedrichs abandoned images the film creates the urban portrait of lisbon that he believes monroes film calls for <0>
{} one thing becomes apparent wenders has very little feel for comedy all his efforts to evoke buster keaton type comedic skits fall flat <-1>
the film rambles pointlessly on and when he catches up with bauchau these scenes of dialogue get pretentious as if they were trying to say something heavy about images and the making of movies but are really saying very little <-1>
{} what was praiseworthy about the film was the singer teresa salgueiro herself and the moody songs she sang she reminded me of a greek rebetika singer singing her heart out <1>
the sensual portuguese sound of a musical group called madredeus becomes the crux and the lifeforce of the film <1>
{} the travelogue tour of lisbon a city that is easy to look at because of its beautiful colors and tranquil streets should come as no surprise since this commercial film was sponsored by the city as a way of boosting tourism <1>
wenders contrasts the splendid structures of the old city with the more modern lisbon not taking sides which one he likes better <0>
{} the great portugese filmmaker manoel de oliveira makes a cameo to deliver a sermon on films asking what use is the universe <0>
a profound question for this lightweight travelogue to probe as this conversation seems forced not happening with the mood of the film nevertheless some good ideas about the values of the older films are discussed here the main point being that we need artists so that they can imitate god <1>
{} i just didnt see much of a story in this somewhat diverting travelogue about lisbon that would compel me to find this semidocumentary as anything but a mildly interesting travelogue <1>

{} reportedly satyajit ray said of all the films he directed that this was his favorite <0>
it is based on rabindranath tagores controversial novella depicting a lonely wifes flirtation with her husbands younger cousin amal soumitr that takes place during the victorian era when india was under british rule as the story unfolds in an opulent calcutta household in giving it a spicy bengali flavor <0>
{} though the plot is simple the human emotions are not and the chance for observing how one feels is maximized in the very perfect structure that ray has created for the film <2>
as charulata madhabi called charu is the neglected and sensitive wife of a newspaper man bhupati shailen who is consumed with the politics of the day with his papers logo being the truth is what survives as he takes pride in his anglican witticisms and the fact that he is not one of those idle rich but is working hard and doing something that is important <0>
at one point of the film his face turns to glee as he is in his newspapers press room and he exclaims that he just loves the smell of the ink press there is nothing better in the world than that smell <0>
{} there is a certain feeling to this bw illustriously cinematographed film that reflects the belief ray has that life is a continual rhythm of birth and death one is complete because of the other <1>
what breaks out in streams of genius love are what volcanically erupts in this rhythmic living flow and what gives sustenance to new beginnings is the force of nature that wells up <2>
as reflected in charu as the flighty and playful yearold amal the opposite of his practical yearold cousin who is encouraged by him to keep the lonely charu company and tutor her which amal does by reading her poetry that awakens her hidden nature as it allows charu a chance to realize for the first time in her life what love for someone else feels like as it churns inside her quite unexpectedly while being with amal <0>
{} amal is too selfabsorbed and loyal to his cousin to notice or to even contemplate what is happening until later on in the story and at that time he reacts by leaving the house and not acting on his true desires <0>
{} the huge house is charus domain as she prates around it with her handmade embroidered slippers and her opera glasses which she coquettishly uses to spy on people as she is bored silly talking prattle with manda gitali the wife of the newspapers manager whose main pleasure in life seems to be when she is having ice cream <0>
from her second floor bedroom window charu will view her kindly but preoccupied husband from this distance with the same equilibrium she reserves for the glances she imparts on the strangers passing by <0>
{} amal writes his literary piece and gets it published in a prestigious magazine called the lotus which inspires charu to let go of her inhibitions <0>
as an inventive bit of photography is used by ray undoubtedly influenced by the french new wave cinema <1>
where we see charus mind in a vortex of activity recalling her past experiences in the village she was brought up in <0>
this turns into her literary piece published in the other prestigious magazine the philanthrope which surprises her husband when his friend nishikanta suku tells him this as he is celebrating with his newspaper friends the victory of gladstone and the liberals in england elated about this because the new government will benefit india more than the former ruling party the tories did <0>
{} the pivotal point of the film is reached by the betrayal of bhupati by someone he completely trusted and made the manager of the newspaper and keeper of the money umapada ghoshal who fails to make payments to keep the paper going and absconds with the stolen money bankrupting the paper and breaking the heart of bhupati who feels that by losing the paper he has lost his cowife <0>
{} this is a film that is visually poetic stunning in its apperceptive recognitions of life in the raw without any wasted movement exerted with expressive gestures counting for unsaid dialogue and untold physical encounters replaced by a nuance such as by a romantic notion as charu has on a swing just by a toss of her head upwards and she is seen in a swoon and a deliberate word from her will slowly be turning into a potion that is magically brewing as it is taking charge of all her pentup emotions as we imagine that we actually can see what is taking place inside the heads of the wouldbe lovers even if nothing explicit materializes <2>
{} the final thrust of emotions erupts inside the already brokenhearted bhupati as he recoups his senses and composure by vacationing at a beach where his wife plucks the first gray hair from him and he returns to the house satisfied that he has worked out a plan with his wife that he run the political part of the paper they will attempt to resuscitate while she will run the literary part <0>
{} once home opening the letter from amal learning that his cousin is living in madras and will accept the arranged marriage that bhupati worked out only brings uncontrollable tears to charu as bhupati awakens for the first time recognizing what is happening between him and his neglected wife and what amal means to her as the camera just stays with him and her in a final fade out freezeframe shot as they join hands like michelangelo joined adams hand with god <0>
and a perfect picture is forged in our memory its feeling so deeply evocative its expressive mood so longingly embraced that we can only be stunned by its sheer exquisiteness for we have come across a chaste romance that is so subtle and delicate that we find it hard to compare it to those in other films knowing we have struck pay dirt with this one for we have seen how a great filmmaker can bring life out into the light like only a master artist can <2>
and we have seen a film that is timeless that will never be outdated as it has already proven by passing the test of time appearing just as modern in when i saw it as it did in when the story took place and as it did in when the film was made <2>

{} robert cormiers young adult novel is about trinity a boys preparatory school for lowtomiddleclass catholics <0>
in the film version the hero succumbs to all the violence around him and gets his revenge as by the films end he happily wins a fist fight from his nemesis <0>
{} this directorial debut by the former actor gordon he was a psycho in john carpenters christine is really a tale about fascism <0>
it is viewed from two sides of school life one is from the side of the malevolent new head of the school brother leon john glover who is insanely mad as he wraps his success in the school around how he can get the students to sell more boxes of chocolate in its annual sale for charity than the other head master did in his tenure <0>
this he thinks will surely impress the schools trustees <0>
the other story is about how the vigils a secret student organization meeting in the school basement also tries to control the student body of nonvigils by making them follow given assignments <0>
the assignments might be in the nature of a prank like unscrewing the seats in a classroom or they might be more politically motivated like making students sell chocolates for the school so that their organization can attain more power in the school <0>
their snakelike leader is a clever bully archie ward whose sense of control is challenged by a shy entering freshman jerry renault smith who refuses to sell the chocolates even after his day assignment by the vigils to not sell the chocolates is over <0>
they view his rebellious action as a threat to their power and do everything they can to make his life miserable including a cowardly physical attack upon him <0>
{} everything that could be wrong about this school is wrong with it as the classroom teachers the brothers all have crosses dangling from their robes as if to remind the viewer that religion was something no one in this school believed in anymore it was just something to be worn for show <0>
it is so perverse a place that there seems to be no way to function in it without selling your soul <0>
the nonconformist act by jerry leaves a sour taste in his mouth as the vigils linking themselves to the new head in an oral agreement that benefits both parties psychologically challenge jerrys sanity as they act as gestapo storm troopers trying to make him an example so that there will be no more dissension on campus <0>
{} the acting is superb <2>
the story is gloomy and perceptive <1>
the problem i had with the film lies in the sense that the only two decent students in the film renault and his friend goober corey have no recourse but to conform <-1>
there seems to be no real voice of reason <-1>
the heroes are too dull and without any real conviction to fight these fascists they are up against <-1>
all the other peripheral vigil characters are weakminded and willing to do anything to advance their own cause in the world <0>
carter adam is a physical bully and an alltowilling strongarm for the group dictator <0>
frank bolo landon is a rotten and stupid thug who cant even look good in his school blazer like the other student fascists he wants to impress with his brashness <0>
archie as student dictator is a despicable worm and treacherous soul who already has the misguided demeanor of an elderly tyrant <0>
obie doug is the creepy guy who is a behind the scenes player currying favor with anyone in power <0>
allinall a pretty disgusting lot which makes this film a tough watch with not enough elasticity to its story than to be more than a comingofage film that ultimately brings up the wrong lesson in life to learn that it is sometimes better to conform than to rebel <-2>
the film itself lacked any sustaining energy to show that it really cared about the enemy it was fighting <-1>
it looked like it was too in love with the evil elite being depicted and invested too much in their presence to properly distance themselves from them and tell the story of the resistance fighter like it needed to be told <-1>

{} a s history of sleazy hollywood and corrupt cops and crime bosses running the city is gone over with a fine eye for detail in this stylized technicolor noir film that also depicts the popular scandal magazine of that era confidential magazine but called in the movie hushhush <1>
this film will evoke memories of films such as chinatown and the bad and the beautiful and of the starlets of that era lana turner veronica lake and rita hayworth <0>
the feel of the movie is of nostalgia for the hollywood glamorous life of that period at least it presents what we are led to believe is glamorous while the paparazzi click their cameras at the action and work handinhand with the cops hoping to catch a hollywood figure with narcotics or in bed with someone who they shouldnt be with or get the goods on some commies in hollywood <0>
crime and violence and corruption run amok in the city but the police use the media to project their police department as the best in the country <0>
{} there are so many wonderful performances that it is difficult to say which one is the best but the russell crowe dumb tough guy muscle man cop takes the cake as far as i am concerned it gives the film the raw energy and view point it wants to get across as he believes whole heartedly in what he is doing as he beats confessions out of those accused of crimes and works over others to get information <2>
he is a regular mr softee for woman and is particularly rough on woman beaters as he explains how he was influenced to become a cop thinking he could do some good for society after watching his dad beat on his mom <0>
kim is the whore made to look like veronica lake working for a millionaire strathairn who sets her up with johns who like doing it with some one who resembles a famous star <0>
she falls for crowe <0>
and believe it or not these are the two most virtuous ones in this flick <0>
{} the main plot of the film involves a stickup in a diner called the night owl where six people are slain including an excop <0>
it soon becomes apparent after the arrest and shooting of the three negroes framed for the job that something big is happening here and it is more than the ordinary crime it first appeared to be <0>
the politically opportunist pearce uses this opportunity to become a hero first arresting the negroes then shooting them when they escape <0>
he gets his promotion to homicide lieutenant and stiffly grins through his clenched shiny teeth <0>
he is hated by the men in the department for breaking the cops code of silence <0>
but he doesnt care he is both ambitious and eager to do his job the right way <0>
he wants to emulate his dad who was a hero detective killed in the line of duty <0>
{} kevin spacey plays jack vincennes as smoothly as he can a role he plays with great relish interested in the glamor of the job he is the technical advisor to the detective tv series badge of honor which is a takeoff on the real tv show of the s dragnet <1>
he works secretly with the sleazy devito character who is the edgy journalist of hushhush magazine <0>
spacey gets money from devito and credits for the arrests and devito scoops the other publications with these hot pictures and stories <0>
{} cromwell is deceptively engaging as the police chief with a heavy irish accent and with the demeanor of a politically connected cop who could look you straight in the eye and make you feel as if you were talking to someone who has the goods on you <0>
his role in the film is crucial for our understanding of the underlying sentiment of how the l a police force has relished its role as savior for the citizenry even if it has to defy what the book says is the right way to conduct a criminal investigation <0>
{} the film is long but it moves at a very brisk pace covering a multitude of subplots <1>
the most disturbing thing about the movie might not be that disturbing if you believe that justice doesnt work anyway and that if the criminal element gets pounded on then so what they are only criminals who would be getting away with crime completely if not for these rogue cops <0>
the would be lesson to be learned from this film is that the only thing that works in uncovering the misdeeds in this city of secret deals and corruption is the ability of strong arming the suspects and gangsters you need info from <0>
the conflict of being a cop in this town is over what one wants his job to be like and why one joined the force in the first place this is answered differently by the three lead cops pearce the new kind of media image cop is out for himself crowe the oldstyle of cop we dont talk to outsiders type and spacey who has forgotten why he joined the force <0>
what was made to seem impossible was a cop who is good at his job and gets promoted legitimately without political influence and is honest <0>
{} maybe the filmmakers are right in their slick attitude or maybe this film is just pure entertainment <-1>
but the film loaded the deck for any other argument and that is what deters me from going overboard and praising this film to the heavens even if it is an exceptionally wellmade cynically humorous and terrifically acted picture but yet it might not be as great as it appears since its subliminal message is that you cant change the system <1>

[20619/a]
{} who finds in life what they dream of <0>
this emotionally moving film will look into that and will also examine the heart aches of two working class girls doing it in a way only the french can do it justice <1>
{} the petite year old isa for isabelle who is loaded down with a full backpack wanders into the cold and grey industrial city of lille <0>
she hopes to stay with a male friend but finds out hes in belgium and ends up remaining in lille for the night <0>
she hopes to pick up some cash by selling touristy postcards on the street which leads to an encounter with a yugoslavian who tells her about a sewing job in a clothing factory <0>
isa being unskilled gets fired after working there only one day but not before meeting a fellow seamstress marie regnier who is the same age <0>
{} isa is someone we think we know but really dont as she is prone to be friendly and willing to make relationships opening her dark saucer eyes wide and offering an engaging smile full of her milky white teeth to go along with her warm personality and trim look of closecropped black hair but we are also distracted by a mysterious scar she has on her right eyebrow which is never explained <0>
there are many things about isa that are unexplained and delightfully mysterious that we accept from her because she is so genuinely likable <1>
{} marie reluctantly puts her up in a beautiful apartment one that she is minding for a mother and a daughter lying comatose in the hospital after a car crash <0>
the mother will die leaving the teenage girl with no visitors except for isa who takes it upon herself to make contact with the girl in the hospital <0>
these encounters brilliantly show what isa is allabout as she wants to will the girl back to life <0>
for isa life holds so much promise and light and love in it that misery alone cannot stop her thoroughly from the angelic path she is on <0>
the journey becomes for her only a question if her dreamlife can become her real life as she will seek the ideal and not be deterred by what roadblocks stand in her way which is something the young can do more readily than the elderly <0>
by the end of the film we wonder what will become of her as the camera pans the sad faces of the women who work all their lives in a factory where isa might have no choice but to end up working in and be exploited by the bosses as it seems that is the pattern of life for a working girl here <0>
{} her relationship with marie is not a very warm one instead it is a workable one <0>
marie is not a trusting or caring person in fact she is most of the time a downer who expects the worst in life and when that happens she cant properly handle it without becoming crazy <0>
{} the tall and slender marie is very attractive but she is also very mixedup emotionally <0>
sex is the only thing that can bring her joy in this world <0>
her relationship with the more spiritually minded isa is based more on convenience than on mutual admiration or anything else since they are both impoverished and seem to be stuck because of their lack of education and inability to fit into society and their inability to meet a guy who they love or who can love them in return <0>
they are workingclass girls seemingly trapped by their birth unable to get what they want from life <0>
each one dreams of a way out but isa as hard as it is to believe from her appearance is the one more grounded in reality the one better prepared to make a go of it in life and she is the one who grows up right in front of us <0>
{} their encounter with the opposite sex comes on their first night together as they try to crash a rock concert without having a ticket but two roughlooking bouncers keep them out while flirting with them <0>
the girls are not attracted to the guys and tell them so in a nasty way but the relationship changes to one of friendship after much banter back and forth <0>
marie ends up going out with the one she insultingly called fat charly mercado and sleeps with him but tells him she doesnt like him enough to have sex with him she will have sex with him twice on later occasions while the other bouncer fredo prestia is smitten with the cute isa but to no avail as she is not taken with him and does not encourage the relationship to go any further than friendship <0>
the guys feel sorry for the penniless girls also they want to keep up a relationship with them so they give them some money to help them out <0>
{} the supposed meal ticket and way out of the trap marie is in comes about unexpectedly as she gets caught shoplifting a leather jacket and meets again chriss colin she once randomly approached him in the street in a hostile manner when she was in a playful mood <0>
he pays for the jacket which she accepts with hostility <0>
she is someone who is terribly concerned about appearances and being humiliated constantly unhappy about her station in life <0>
he will turn out to be a womanizer and she will be one more girl in his series of conquests but is too blinded by her own dreams to see this though all the signs are there <0>
his nightclub his father bought it for him happens to be the place where the girls bouncer friends work <0>
{} isa in need of money tucks in her pride and takes on the temp job of dressing like a fool putting on rollerskates and advertising sandwichboards <0>
marie however will not <0>
she cant handle the demeaning nature of the job <0>
{} a steady rift grows between the women as marie thinks shes got what she wants with her relationship with chriss and doesnt need isa anymore and acts hostile toward her <0>
all isa is trying to do is clue her friend into not falling for chriss telling her that he will only drop her when he wants to these remarks only make marie more insulting towards her <0>
there is a classic look of disgust on the face of isa that seems to be saying you are really sick when she finally realizes that she has to move on from here <0>
{} the performances of the two actresses was bewitching as the two women deservedly shared best actress honors last year at cannes <2>
{} the poignancy and merits of the film are in depicting accurately the reality of the girls lives <0>
it is a film without one false note of sympathy or sentimentality in it <1>
this is not the type of a girlbuddy movie as seen in some hollywood films of late filled with glibness and glitter and canned experiences <0>
here what happens has the ring of truth to it and is powerful in the sense that its simple telling of the tale without trying to be cute or pedantic turns out to be profound <0>
it caught a certain inexpressible joy there is to life the kind of joy where one can connect with someone else and feel satisfied in doing that because what you are doing is true just like isa did when she befriended the girl in the coma <2>
{} this debut film for the yearold director done with the austerity of a master reminiscent of someone like a robert bresson is a work of considerable merit <2>
it is a film that not only depicted the shattering of a friendship and a realistic look at life for the working class but it probed into the deep seated loneliness found within each of the girls looking at it in a poetic way <2>

{} strange bizarre confusing and psychedelic all are apt descriptions for this easy to follow story but most difficult film to keep track of <0>
that is mainly due to the elliptical editing fast cuts forward and backward flashbacks and a montage of images with all kinds of implications behind them <0>
it is a film that of all studios for warner bros to come out with it just doesnt make sense <0>
this is not the type of independent artistic film they make over there <0>
their reaction to seeing the finished product was predictably one of disbelief and disgust <0>
they felt they had been dirtied by having their name associated with this film and with donald cammell the former artist now film director refusing the studios demands to cut huge portions of the film therefore the film was put on hold for a few years until cammell was called back to finish the film his way <0>
nicolas roeg at that point disassociated himself from the film but since his name was left on it and cammell was an inexperienced yearold director roeg unfairly received the lions share of the critical credit that was to come from some of the established critics who true to form didnt recognize what an innovative and masterful film it was until much later <0>
an underground audience wellaware of the peyote mushrooms and psychedelic flashes throughout the film rushed to see it in a partylike hippie atmosphere during the midnight hours it was shown to packed audiences <0>
warner bros was clueless how to market the film whether to make it a mick jagger rock experience or as a gangster film <0>
therefore the film floundered in the box offices across straight america and was quickly pulled out of the theaters by the unhappy studio executives <0>
{} chas james fox is the muscle man for a london protection racket run by a puff the egotistical and perverted harry flowers johnny shannon <0>
that chas is an anal compulsive an artist in his field of enforcement a takeoff on the british gangster jimmy evans thoroughly enjoying his work of putting the fright into those who cross the organization is shown as he leaves the woman wickens he just slept with and goes to work smartly dressed in a suit and tie warning the accused on trial for an unethical merger that hell be in a wheel chair if he implicates harry flowers in any way <0>
when his lawyer butts in saying he is not intimidated chas returns with the boys rosy meadows and dennis morton and they gag the lawyers chauffeur and razor cut his hair and take a bucket of acid to the lawyers rolls royce ruining the paint job <0>
the next one they go after is one of the east enders chas grew up with and whom he now hates for various personal reasons joey maddocks valentine who is being forced into joining the organization and giving up control of his horse betting parlor <0>
harry warns chas to stay out of this keep your personal things out of the business <0>
when the boys decorate joeys place chas walks in when its over and rubs it into joey taking him to see harry <0>
joey joins the organization gleeful at seeing harry admonish chas for not listening to him and calling him mockingly the lone ranger <0>
{} joey will jump chas in his flat after they leave harrys wrecking the place and pouring red paint all over it and with the help of two of his boys pin down chas and whip the daylights out of him <0>
somehow chas gets free and shoots joey which turns out to be his downfall as he now has to go on the run from the gang and from the police <0>
{} one of the highlights of the first half of the film was the nude dance number performed by the harry flowers gang <0>
they danced sang an ode to harry and we saw that they can be just as notorious as americas gangsters <0>
their overt homosexuality indicated that homosexuals wield tremendous power within his crime organization and probably have some impact in britains gangster world <0>
{} the next half of the film is about chas finding shelter in the notting hill home of a once famous pop singer turner mick jagger who is now reclusive living with two foreign women in an exotic sexual relationship with the wellbuilt pherber anita and the skinny masculine looking lucy breton <0>
what abounds in jaggers bohemian place are head trips mindscrewings merging of personalities and sexual characteristics <0>
each artist is currently stuck and in a dilemma on how to resolve their problem fox enjoyed his work too much and didnt know when to stop and is now doomed <0>
jagger has lost his demon for madness which gives him his creativity to perform <0>
it seems as if in a strange way these two opposites have similar impulses that give them their power to succeeed <0>
this is jaggers thought as he attempts the merging of their personalities alchemically by feeding fox those potent mushrooms and getting him confused about his masculinity and who he really is until jagger can digest his trip fully and trade places with him even though he knows fox is in extreme danger of losing his life <0>
{} fox needs to get a passport from tony colley someone he can rely on as he phones him for help to escape to america a very good place for gangsters and performers to go to <0>
unfortunately for fox he is doublecrossed by tony who tips harry off to where he is <0>
{} as a reward for getting into foxs head jagger is shot by him when harrys boys come to take chas away on a ride he will never return from <0>
i guess it is one head trip exchanged for another each doing it the way they know best <0>
{} the violent trip that fox is on has been around forever as under the hallucinogenic drug time becomes irrelevant and we are treated to all sorts of images from his past and present life plus a glaring look at francis bacons homoerotic art work which makes reality and fantasy become hard to distinguish <0>
chas is very uncomfortable with losing complete control of the situation yet he sticks to who he thinks he is pretending to be normal even though he has been sexually crosseddressed by pherber losing his sense of complete manliness and is scrutinized by jagger as he tries to reclaim the image he has of himself <0>
chas looks and acts as anything but what society would take for normal <0>
the last image we have of him is as pherber dressed him as he enters harrys white cadillac and his face looks just like jaggers but harry happily greets him as chas as if he was becoming reaquainted with an old friend <0>
{} performance is also noted for its memorable music as arranged by the rock genius jack nietzche <1>
some of the music played was by the last poets a bitter rap song about the the big apple randy newman long dead train buffy saint marie dyed dead red and ry cooder bootleneck guitar <0>
{} warner bros tried suing the director cammell after seeing how he completed the film hoping not to release it thats how bad the feelings were for a film that lived on to become a cult favorite even though it never got its proper due with the straight critics and public <0>
cammell committed suicide in copying the style used by fox when he executed jagger and supposedly remaining conscious for minutes after the shooting but was in no pain as reported by friends <0>
for him murder turned out to be truly a work of art <0>
{} it was a film whose psychedelic flashes might seem a bit dated now but all the best directors from kubrick to scorsese borrowed freely from it as it changed the way many mainstream films were to be made after <1>
the freshness and energy and montages of the film are unique as it was able to mix the world of art with violence something that seems to be a natural fit as shown in these kaleidoscope images <1>
what results is the merging from the opposite worlds of the underworld and underground as influenced by the business of making money the holy grail at the end of the journey <0>
it is a film that both gangsters and artists can sink their teeth into even if the gangster might fail to recognize how he looks to others or to himself <0>
{} a one of a kind film deserving of much critical praise as it is a most efficacious look at the subculture of the gangster and artist worlds and simultaneously a most enigmatic film to try and take in all its fanciful images and perversions and drug induced fantasies though time has taken away some of its freshness it still is a work of considerable power <2>

{} it is a politically oppressive climate in the madrid of the s with the dictator franco in power <0>
a woman gives birth on a city bus during christmas time and the city honors her and her new born son victor liberto with a lifetime bus pass <0>
victors mom supports her son by being a prostitute <0>
{} the film flashes to years later and we see victor and he seems to be a social misfit angry and disappointed that the beautiful druggie italian diplomats girl elena neri the one he made love to for him it was the first time he ever made love in a public toilet a week ago has broken her date with him because she thinks he is a jerk and a lousy lay <0>
a disasterous evening follows as he tries to force his way into her apartment to get an explanation for why she has rejected him as cops are called to the scene and he ends up shooting and paralysing one of the cops david bardem <0>
that is the cop elena is immediately smitten with upon seeing him enter the room <0>
the other cop sancho sancho goads victor unnecessarily into trying to wrestle the gun out of his hand and the gun goes off hitting david causing the injury <0>
sancho in response to the inward tension that was eating at him suspecting his wife of cheating on him took out his jealous hatred on the unfortunate victor <0>
so goes a story filled with coincidences frameups despair psychological traumas political digressions lies revenge biblical allusions to redemption and marriagegorounds <0>
{} victor is released from prison after serving years a time he spent bulkingup reading the bible learning bulgarian thats a funny one and swearing he would learn how to make love to a woman <0>
{} victor upon his release from prison immediately makes contact with and starts an affair with sanchos wife angela <0>
her husband is the cop who caused his arrest <0>
{} he also finds that elena is married to the paralysed cop david who is now a star basketball player on spains special olympic team <0>
elena cleaned up her act and is working as a director of a school where he finagles his way into a job there since he is so naturally good around children <0>
his motive in returning to see elena is to take her to bed and show her how he has become a good lay and to show her what she is missing by not being with him <0>
the only problem with his strategy is that she is not happy to see him <0>
{} there are too many coincidences for me to be wholly convinced that i am not being manipulated into accepting a story with a certain political agenda to it but there are so many wonderful gripping and beautifully done scenes that i found i was taken in by the relationships going on and curious about what would happen to these folks and glad that almodovar dark habits high heels women on the verge of a nervous breakdown has chosen to make a film this time that has a story that makes some sense <2>
i found most of his other films to be basically sexually bizarre with storylines that were not particularly lucid <0>
{} clara who is only a minor figure in this story nevertheless her story is the one that moved me the most <1>
her failed marriage and her need to be loved and love someone was the most pathetic characterization in the film outside of victors <0>
{} the strength in the film was in the showing of the strong erotic links to each of the main characters in the story through victors eyes <1>
elena showed that she could change from the strungout druggie depicted in her first encounters with victor into becoming a respectable wife and dogooder <0>
victor could become the lover he never was and find a way to redemption for his past injustices <0>
his story is the most challenging one and the one that is hardest to comprehend <0>
he is symbolic of modern spain <0>
{} almodovar has shot a sophisticated film about characters who really develop characterwise and who are intune with the times they live in <1>
almodovar by his intermingling of the past and the present with the strange mixture of politics and religion that changes with the times has created a fascinating look at spain in the th century <0>
what he shows are the diverse ingredients found in modern day spain that makes his country so unique <0>
{} the closing optimistic scene of the politically new madrid the one without the ruthless dictator franco who died of a heart attack in his bed is opposite from the opening scene of the oppressively sullen madrid <0>
this film is definetly one of almodovars more resolute efforts <1>

[21248/b+]
{} the tune emanating from the piano is a passionate one coming forth on a desolate new zealand coastline far removed from european culture where a piano is seen as something peculiar to possess in such a backward area of the world <0>
it is used symbolically to represent the works of civilization that can soothe the savage beast if the beast is lonely and willing to listen to something he usually doesnt listen to <0>
{} the underlying premise of the film is one of communication or lack of it in a world that can be cold and of how easy it is to never find love in such a world <0>
the coastline is a place where the sky and sea are dismally gray and it rains all the time where the native maoris with their tattooed faces and the white settlers of this nineteenth century tale are living in a marshy forest with the settlers trying to live by the rules they were accustomed to in europe but are now faced with muddy roads and squalid living conditions making their life almost unbearable and to top that off the two diverse groups seem unable to see each others point of view as the maoris mock the settlers under their breath and the settlers treat the natives as if they were children <0>
{} it is a place where the characters either cant talk the bride or cant listen the new husband or are spiteful the daughter in a film that unrelentingly studies the affects of erotic yearnings in a restrictive society <0>
and who can forget the powerful image it leaves the viewer of the piano left abandoned in its crate against the forlorn backdrop of the rushing surf and the desolate beach <0>
{} ada holly is a young mute in her early thirties for some inexplicable reason she has not been able to talk since she was years old <0>
her voiceover says this is not the sound of my voice you are hearing it is the sound of my mind <0>
she is seen in the films opening arriving in new zealand by boat and then being rowed by canoe ashore coming all the way from her native scotland for an arranged mailorder marriage at her fathers insistence <0>
she is accompanied by her year old daughter flora paquin as she awaits on the beach with all her possessions to meet her unseen british emigrant husband stewart neill who is trying to make a go of it by cultivating the land in this bush country <0>
the only two things she cares about in life are with her on the beach her daughter and her piano <0>
{} the contradiction of a deaf mute playing music is underscored by the tremendous joyous feeling that it exudes in ada as it is her only real contact with the world and the piano is something that this fiercely proud woman cannot live without <0>
{} she is soon met by the anxious groom seen trying to comb his unruly hair but who doesnt have the presence of mind to give the ladies a kindly welcome instead orders the maoris accompanying him to start bringing all the luggage with them except for the piano <0>
he is not listening to his new bride who writes him anxious notes and talks in a hand sign language to her daughter who translates as she urgently tells him the piano is hers and she must keep it even above her other worldly possessions <0>
but her insensitive and demanding husband who actually wishes for a woman who is totally mute one who does not even play the piano tells her the piano cant be taken with them on their long trek to the house because it is too heavy for the maori laborers to carry and he refuses to return for it at a later date <0>
also at the beach watching these precedings is a coarselooking white man gone native tattooing his face maori style saying nothing about what he sees taking place <0>
the name of this exwhaler now laborer is baines keitel <0>
{} the illiterate baines is overtaken with joy after hearing ada play the piano when she returned to the beach <0>
she is despondent about her marriage and refuses to offer her shy husband any affection and thusly plays her heart out in the only way she knows how to communicate her feelings <0>
baines thereby decides to make a deal with stewart for the piano offering him some land for it if he can also receive piano lessons from his wife <0>
when the lessons begin he tells ada that he wants to receive sexual favors from her <0>
he starts off slowly by lifting up her skirt when she plays and will eventually take her into his bedroom <0>
in return after a series of such sexual encounters adding up to the number of black keys there are the piano will go back to her <0>
that makes the relationship that develops between the two seem devilishly strange <0>
these scenes are very powerful and surprisingly enough come across as being sensual even if the proposal as putforth at first seemed to be an obvious powerplay against a hapless victim <0>
but campion knows how to draw out the passions from these scenes and make this unlikely romance between these opposites bloom <0>
it all seems plausible because their physical wants are motivating them to act this way toward each other <0>
in the beginning she pretends to be repulsed by him but eventually she warms up to him in fact she looks forward to the lessons <0>
she does all the playing while he listens as the music gives off the vibes she wants to communicate <0>
all that he knows is that he just wants her physically that he feels her inside his gut and that he turns out to be a more sensitive person than at first thought possible is precisely what gives impetus to this gothic romance <0>
{} possibly the most complex character in the story is the little girl who is shown to be cute as a button a seemingly loyal companion of her mother an able liar and a bit of a prude <0>
but on the spur of the moment one day she fails to follow her mothers orders to deliver a message to baines someone her husband has now forbidden her to see and does something that turns out to be devastating betraying her mother by impishly delivering the message to stewart instead of baines knowing exactly what she is doing but somewhat astonished to her regret about what tragedy this brings about for her mother <0>
{} michael nymans astonishing score performed by holly hunter herself expresses the explosive mood of this extraordinary visionary film <1>
a film whose silence and music speaks for itself as an apt way of communicating <2>
the two men want ada even though each of them is not really suited for her as one represents a cold and frustrated civilized society while the other is able to express the feelings he has inside himself without being uptight about it just like the natives of the culture he adopted are able to so easily do <0>
{} with stewart embroiled in jealousy fighting off his loneliness and repressions unable to be a warm person and fulfill his marriage duties properly he is seen as a lost soul out of his elements in a wild country he cant even begin to fathom <0>
he is stuck in the trap he built for himself struggling to work the land and tame his restless soul <0>
sam neill is stupendous as the lost soul wrestling with his passions <0>
harvey keitel masking a nyc accent by talking in some kind of maori pigeon tongue is ably cast as the brooding lover who turns out to have a gentle soul something this loner must have felt in his heart for a long time but now emerges inside him and gives the film a certain kind of raw power to it <1>
anna paquin in my opinion is the best surprise in the film the one with the most difficult role and the one with the biggest part in the film <2>
what makes it all the more amazing is that she is a mere child asked to play a part on equal footing with all the accomplished actors she is surrounded by <0>
holly hunter with a gaunt ashstriken face is mesmorizing in a role that she emotionally is in perfect harmony with <2>
her performance is the key one it is the one that propels the film to give it its needed air of desperation and to outline the passionate struggle between just surviving and living for love <0>
she is strangely rejuvenated by the naturalism and lack of inhibitions found in this backward place and the passion she feels from baines as it seeps into her repressed soul and transforms her <0>
{} the film is brought slowly together by jane campions masterful direction whose understanding of the erotic desires of the characters is right on the mark with the result being an original and haunting film a story that grew more intensively disturbing for me the longer i thought about it <2>
stuart dryburghs camera captures the internal mood of the characters as well as the monotonous beauty and the oppressive reality of the countryside <1>
but the film misses the mark at times as the two main characters stewart and baines despite their fine performances are nevertheless too onedimensional to give the film more of an impact <-1>
it seems as if this is adas story to tell and no one elses <0>
this is a film nevertheless that will justifiably garner great interest because of her very trying performance <2>

[21899/d]
{} a hollowwood production that couldnt be more hollow or hollywood in style and to its only benefit is visually pleasing <0>
it presents a classic mysterious aura about it through scenes of thick fog horrid decapitations and framed shots as if it was a period art picture coming off its frame and onto the screen <2>
but the story thats a different story it is abominable <-2>
it is so ridiculous and incredulous that the filmmaker completely ruins washington irvings great short story <-2>
it is not the imaginative parable it was meant to be but a story about a serial killer <0>
so you can forget the book obviously tim burton did that is if he ever read it <-1>
here he throws away any imagination derived from the once a very long time ago popular book <-1>
in the late s the storys legend was common knowledge across most of america <0>
{} the film is not helped by a cast i might add a rather talented cast of british and americans that are sleepwalking through their parts <-2>
the two stars who have inane and unappealing and underwritten roles and seem to be acting as if they have no idea of what they are saying or doing in this film but seem to enjoy playing it up for the camera while showing no chemistry for any romance to be deemed possible between them which without the two stars being credible performers the film has little chance of succeeding <-2>
{} this film has box office appeal as a date movie for the high school set comforting each other as they snack on popcorn which the theater owners will be largely appreciative of and the teens in all probability will be reacting with bemused glee or mock horror to all the packets of ketchup unleashed during the headless horsemans romp through the sleepy hollow of <0>
who else this movie should appeal to is not for me to judge <0>
but when the audience leaves the theater no harm is done this is a totally forgettable film <0>
there is no need to worry about nightmares over the gratuitous violence seen <0>
this one is so obviously just a movie that it cant even begin to match the book for its eloquence and the great manner of the books very germane writing style that is both lucid and thought provoking <-1>
if anything good can be said about this film it would be that it brings back to the publics attention the forgotten writer washington irwing someone who knew how to craft a ghost story back in the turnofthethcentury and is still very readable <0>
its just too bad that a good movie couldnt result from such an accessible work <-1>
{} its best to forget about this movie as in any way connected with the novel the only thing that seems to jive is the time period the location and the character called ichabod crane depp <-1>
but this time crane is a constable leaving nyc on orders from his superiors to hunt down a serial killer by using his innovative sherlock holmeslike logical detection methods which are not appreciated by the local police authorities in nyc <0>
so crane is not the schoolteacher and choirmaster as he was depicted in the book <0>
from here on the movie is off on its own tangent playing havoc with the story <-2>
katrina van tassel christina ricci the wealthy daughter of the local farmer will be cranes love interest though she already has a suitor in the brave but chillingly jealous brom van brunt casper van dien <0>
in the book the headless horseman is imaginary <0>
it is brom who dresses up as one to frighten the naive ichabod away from his rich and attractive woman and it is the only way the story can make sense <0>
in the movie the horseman is real and the story becomes a vulgar mystery with some inept attempt to bring in an air of magical mystery to it and it almost completely ignores the romantic rivalry between the two suitors which was at the heart of irvings story <0>
{} the town fathers reverend steenwyck jones magistrate philipse griffiths notary hardenbrook gough and including the now wealthiest resident of sleepy hollow baltus van tassel michael gambon the father of katrina married to her stepmother lady van tassel miranda <0>
all the town fathers believe the previous murders to be the work of a legendary headless horseman who haunts the area but the skeptical crane scoffs at this <0>
it is only after he sees for himself that this is true that he decides there is a motive behind these serial murders they are not random acts of violence <0>
tim burton edward scissorhands ed wood mars attacks batman has succeeded in robbing the story of anything but a cursory look at irvings story <-1>
how a film could go so far afield is not unusual for hollywood but in this case the film has gone too far afield from the story to even claim it is based on the book <-1>
burton has made a story about a headless horseman who lives inside a tree trunk and is controlled by a twisted person who uses him to commit murders that will benefit their cause but he has miserably failed to capture the imagination the story requires in its storytelling <0>
{} i would suggest reading the short story about pages before or after seeing the film and then see what you think of the film <0>
i read the book after the film and am grateful that it called washington irving to my attention again <0>
otherwise i cant say enough bad things about the films crass aim to take away the imagination of the story and replace it with not one shred of what irving was after in his ghost story about romantic jealousy but here becoming a story about jejune classical horror images and a tacked on banal murder story <-2>
ill admit the movie looked good better than most horror movies i might have raved about but even with all the gory murders taking place and an excuse for a whodoneit movie evolving a tedium setin and the film seemed to lack suspense breath and dimension and like a beautiful person without much else what else can you say that is complimentary after you say you look good <1>

{} the persian gulf war of is put to celluloid and made into this actionpacked adventure story and intelligent political satire of the once seemingly popular war that would supposedly regain the american sense of feeling good about itself that needed resurrection after the vietnam debacle <0>
this was a war that made americans proud of the technology developed such as smart bombs and of how casualty free and quickly the war was won as it was watched on tv <0>
{} david o russell spanking the monkeyflirting with disaster sets his contemporary story in iraq during the immediate aftermath of the gulf war as he lampoons the motives behind u s foreign policy questioning what president bushs war really accomplished even if it did succeed in liberating kuwait <0>
he has made an unconventional but traditional antiwar hollywood movie in the likes of films such as catch and m a s h <0>
this one has a potent bite to it just like the others but maybe because it is filmed so soon after the bubble for american success has busted that it seems to have such a deliciously absurd bite to it <1>
with saddam hussein still in power and the fact that there are military personal still in harms way over there at a great cost to this country as this country is stuck with the problem of making sure saddam doesnt rebuild his army with nuclear weapons <0>
it makes one wonder who the americans really have helped with this war aside from some rich kuwaitis <0>
what the film clearly shows is that the bulk of the iraqi people not the inner circle of the dictator seem to be bearing the brunt of the wars dire consequences <0>
{} the story begins as three army reservists called up to fight the war but not seeing any action come upon a map of hidden gold bullions stolen by saddam hussein from the kuwaitis stuffed up a prisoners crack in his butt and decide to go after the gold on their own <0>
they are sgt troy barlow mark wahlberg who sees this as an opportunity to provide his wife and infant back home with some financial security conrad vig spike jonzedirector of being john malkovich a high school dropout who wants to be like troy so much so that he would follow him anywhere and staff sgt chief elgin ice cube someone who believes he can put a magical circle of jesus around himself and be protected from any harm <0>
their plans change when a cynical veteran of the special forces captain archie gates george clooney who is about to retire from the service gets wind of what these men have found and takes charge of the smelly situation and the three become a quartet of rogues <0>
{} these selfseeking fortune hunters who have forgotten about their army duty in favor of doing whats best for themselves decide that they should have the stolen gold instead of saddam or kuwait <0>
they go out in a stolen humvee across the iraqi desert to find the hidden bunker that holds the gold and they find the gold alright but they also find iraqi rebels intent on rising up against saddam <0>
saddams army is busy putting down the rebellion an uprising in which president bush is sending out mixed messages where on the one hand he tells the iraqis to revolt and america will help but on the other hand he decides not to help them and does nothing to stop saddam from killing those who were foolish enough to believe the american president <0>
this helps these rogues to take advantage of the situation as saddams loyalists look the other way when they take the gold and instead will focus solely on the rebels <0>
{} the americans escape with forty million in goldas the iraqi soldiers let them go unharmed but they get caught in a crossfire between the rebels and saddams soldiers and the americans wrestle with their consciences as captain gates their philosophical leader decides to change his mind and to become altruistic and help the rebels get out of harms way despite the problem it now leaves them with of escaping with the gold as saddams men start to go after them and will capture troy in the shootout <0>
{} troy is brought back to the bunker of saddams elite forces and is tortured as the iraqi soldier sa taghmaoui tells him that america only fights for the oil and has done a tremendous amount of killing and mutilation including killing his child and crippling his wife with its bombing policy and for him to believe that the americans have come to the aid of kuwait for the sake of justice is laughable if justice alone was the reason for their help then america would have to become policeman for the world and would always be coming to the aid of victimized countrys <0>
he compares what his country did in stealing the gold with what troy and his group are now selfishly doing for themselves <0>
{} the premise of the film is excellent the story succeeds as both an entertaining action film and as a searingly funny black comedy it is even effective as a valuable history lesson <2>
there are plenty of odd touches that give the film a fresh feel to it such as an exploding cow footballs that explode a slow motion shot tracing the horrorific damage a bullet does when it enters the body as it shows that most victims die from sepsis that results from a release of bile into the bloodstream and finally to the scene of a rebel bunker full of stolen kuwaiti luxury cars being comically bartered to the americans by the rebels chief officer <1>
{} the actors are brilliantly cast and make up for the lack of depth of their characters by giving engaging performances george clooney is both heroic and devilish presenting a commanding stature for his authoritative role <2>
wahlberg as the naive allamerican boy with a dark side to him serves the film well <2>
jonze is a real hoot and comes across as the kind of dim soldier whom it is easy to feel sorry for and not get too upset with him over his obvious mental defects <0>
ice cube is solid <1>
nora dunn as adrianna cruz a cnntype of reporter out for the hard facts of the war but given the runaround by the military brass captures the essence of this media war in all its gamesmanship <0>
what results is a brave film one that has a surreal and trippy feel to it with some mortifying comedy dished out and some serious questions being raised about a war that cant come to a proper conclusion anytime too soon as russell explores a recent part of american history that surprisingly hasnt been touched upon by other films as of yet <1>
{} the war is covered with more personal detail than i got from watching it on cnn <1>
i feel that the filmmaker has caught the mood of most of the soldiers who dont understand the politics of the war and just want to go home in one piece of the career brass who are in it for promotions the media reporters who want to not only get the story but be the first one to get it and the politicians who can find a rational for whatever they do <1>
the film ultimately shows that anything is possible in the amoral climate of a dictatorship and a consumer country out to protect its own interest <0>
the three kings turns out not to be a film about wisemen as a biblical allusion of which the title alludes to but is about four typical americans who must make difficult choices that go against their grain of nature <0>
the reward for the audience is seeing an exciting film with beautiful cinematography in addition to seeing a film that has a grave purpose to it and is funny in a serious way <2>

[20736/c+]
{} theres something about mary is a very funny film it makes the most out of being politically incorrect profane obnoxious and settling for an unsophististicated juvenile humor to tide itself over while the romantic side of its tale fizzles <1>
it makes fun of the retarded abuses a pet dog to a point of near death and makes no apology for being so crude <0>
there are many other things that the film does wrong but the bottom line is that it is funny in a way that is not meanspirited <1>
if the film could be faulted it is because it runs too long and seemed sluggish at times and the romantic tale was pointless <-1>
{} it starts in rhode island when the teenage sad sack ted stroehmann ben stiller is looking for a date to the prom after being cruelly rejected by a calculating coed <0>
but his luck soon changes as he is asked to the prom by the perfect girl the heartthrob of the high school mary jensen cameron diaz when ted defends her retarded brother warren w earl brown who is being picked on <0>
but his prom date turns out to be a disaster <0>
when picking up mary in her house he is unmercifully ribbed by marys black stepfather keith and then beaten up by warren ted had touched warrens ears and warren doesnt let anyone touch his ears <0>
ted then excuses himself to go to the bathroom and is staring at two birds by the window when they fly away he is spotted by mary as she is undressing and she thinks he is scoping her <0>
ted is startled to see her look of disgust and catches himself in his zipper which results in a hilarious bit where he is taken to the hospital and misses the prom <0>
it is funny because it is so grossly done that at first it is hard to believe how far this tasteless gag is going but it is taken to the hilt as the police and fire departments arrive and the neighborhood gets to see an unusual occurrence it even ends with the showing of the wounded private part <0>
{} it is now years later in rhode island and ted is a lonely writer telling his slimy friend dom chris elliott that he hasnt seen the one girl he loves in all that time only knowing that she moved to miami beach <0>
dom talks him into getting a private eye who works in his place to go down there and see if he can locate her for him <0>
the sleazy investigator pat healy matt dillon finds mary in miami and falls for her so much so that he quits his job in rhode island and moves to miami to romance her <0>
to find out what shes like and whats she looking for in a guy he eavesdrops on her conversations using a hidden microphone and thusly sets himself up to become her dream man <0>
that will become the running gag for the remainder of the movie <0>
but he is so crude that even though he knows exactly what she wants he still blows it but acting like a jerk <0>
{} ted is able to find out that the private detective lied to him about mary and decides to drive down there by himself to see her <0>
when he picks up a weirdo hitchhiker and cant take his rap anymore stopping by the road in south carolina to relieve himself he stumbles upon a homosexual orgy and is arrested on a live tv program which his friend dom sees <0>
he will go down there to help ted who is now being charged with not only indecent exposure but of being a serial murderer as the hitchhiker fled the car leaving his bag with chopped up body parts on the front seat <0>
but he is soon cleared of the charges and ends up in miami with dom <0>
{} there are some more phony admirers of mary led by the deceptive tucker lee evans who acts as a crippled architect befriending the very naive mary and by duplicitous means getting rid of the boys shes interested in <0>
the combination of these three suitorsthe sincere nerd ted and the pencilthin mustached private eye charlatan and the limber scoundrel tucker all play well off each other <1>
football player brett favre also gets into the game as a suitor of mary and there are a few other twists in the story which are soso funny <0>
{} many of the grossly funny bits work to various degrees such as drugging the dog with speed mocking the mentally retarded kid having the results of masturbation be used unwittingly by mary as hair gel a chris elliott with zits all over his face and the withered bare breasts of an old woman <1>
what didnt work was how stupid and low the comedy had to go to get its laughs and the whole romantic scene that without the comedy would have been a tedious watch <-1>
{} this raunchy comedy created by the farrelly brothers who gave us dumb and dumber and kingpin is a winner only for those who dont mind being grossed out <0>
i must confess i laughed a lot during the film but i wasnt completely won over with so much comedy that depended on making fun of someone elses problems <-1>
it made the romantic part of the romanticcomedy seem unneeded <-1>
as a nice added touch the film had a singing troubadour jonathan richman appearing throughout the film in various settings to sing about mary and what makes her so special <1>

{} it is an unconventional mainstream film whose aim is to target a perpetually youthoriented audience anyone from aged to who want to identify with a film that is rebellious against society and their institutions <0>
it succeeds mostly in being a visceral experience and for those who like to see brad pitt pecs and how edward norton squirms when beaten up and be bemused to hear helena bonham carter complain that the boys sure love their violence more than they do sex <0>
{} the film eventually knocks itself out from hitting itself so much in the old noggin without really damaging its unspecified opponent society as a whole <0>
the sheer nonsense of its storyline causes that knockout by relying on a ridiculous metaphor to make its point too much glitter and pitt and norton overacting what results is a jarring experience enough to make you think without thinking that being sadomasochistic is the way to achieve respect it doesnt matter if this is meant to be a parody reflecting the violence in america the violence is the thing in this story that the audience will remember most about this film <0>
it succeeds in this venture only as a disturbing film which makes the provocative assertion that those who are selfabsorbed and mindless and go overtheedge by doing violent acts are supposedly looking for hidden meanings in their life which are given to them by false prophets something that is happening currently in america to a great extent <1>
but this film is too stilted unconvincing and inane to be the messenger delivering a warning about such dangers in society <-2>
{} but if its comedy that it is after then it has some success in meeting those expectations as the stars were able to project themselves into this story with enough animation to give the film a titillating lift <1>
{} the film features a listless narrator named jack edward norton to tell its story <0>
he calls himself many names but no one in the film calls him by his right name which is supposed to indicate that he is a symbol for the anonymous worker in contemporary america <0>
he is a rather inconspicuous type a further symbol of the modern man caught in the ratrace of the high tech world who will tell us his losers story of how as an unmarried yearold he feels unsatisfied with himself and with the way his life is going <0>
we first see him in the opening scene being forced to flash back on his life as the films other protagonist in this nightmarish farce the specterlike tyler durden brad pitt has him tied to a chair and with a gun pointed inside his mouth and is asking him to tell him what he is thinking about before he dies <0>
{} his story unfolds via flashbacks from his tied up position as he tries to piece together what happened to him after he met tyler and the film goes on for a dreary minutes of non cinematic narration intermixed with an orgy of visual innovativeness <-1>
{} he meets the nefarious tyler on an airplane and comes to live with him in the toxic part of town where he resides as he is invited into the squatters dilapidated vacant house when returning from his airplane flight and discovering that his condo was blown up <0>
{} the more we get to know about the engaging soap salesman who is selling not only soap but a nihilistic philosophy the more we learn how depraved he is <0>
we are told that he makes his product from discarded liposuctioned human fat which he steals from the waste removal garbage cans and then sells them to boutiques who sell the product for a bar he also works parttime as a movie projectionists splicing in penises into the childrens film cinderella that is currently showing and he also works parttime as a waiter in a ritzy hotel where he urinates in the soup now isnt that a pisser <0>
{} while the narrator is shown to be an uptight yuppie living for material comfort in particular collecting expensive scandinavian furniture to assuage his empty soul and define himself as a person <0>
he works at a wellcompensated but corrupt job for a big car manufacturer as the representative for the company who goes out to investigate car crashes where the manufacturer he represents is being sued and it is his job to decide if it is cheaper to recall the malfunctioning parts that caused the accident or to fight the suit filed against the manufacturer <0>
human lives are not part of this equation <0>
{} evidently as we get to know these two opposites we determine that they are perfectly suited for each other <0>
a homoerotic edge to their relationship is also hinted at but like everything in this film it is only superficially covered <0>
{} the narrator suffers from insomnia probably caused by his nonmeaningful life <0>
upon an inadvertent remark made by his physician who refuses to prescribe sleeping pills or pain killers for him but tells him if you want to see real pain see how the men in the support group who have testicular cancer feel <0>
the narrator takes the doctor up on that idle suggestion and finds comfort there by crying on the shoulders of one of the men he is paired with big bob paulsen meatloaf <0>
finding it therapeutic to listen to someone else talk about their real pain and seeing that it will actually allow him to sleep like a baby he therefore becomes a support group junkie joining a wide variety of these selfhelp groups under false pretenses <0>
it is here that he meets another phony who also goes to these groups even though she doesnt have the disease the group calls for the streetwise emotionally bankrupt marla singer helena bonham carter who is addicted to attending meetings <0>
she is a tourist like him going through life without finding herself <0>
but she spoils his game as a faker as he wants to be the only fake there and to be the one who is nurtured by the real pain of others <0>
{} the heart of the story takes place when the budding friendship between the two diverse misfits develops <0>
the utterly depraved tyler exhibiting the ability to be a leader with a need to offer sanctimonious maxims against the emptiness of materialism such as you are not your job and the irresolute narrator who is someone crying out for help and who is also someone ripe for being brainwashed <0>
{} their relationship blossoms on their first night out when drinking together and violence becomes the prerequisite for continuing it as they take turns beating each other up and with this added expression of meaning to their life bringing great satisfaction to them they decide to open up what they call a fight club in the cellar of a bar allowing other disgruntled types to voice their need for violence in their lives and to give them a sense of what real pain is <0>
theres a series of rules including the cleverly stated rule number and no one talks about the club <0>
that all this is supposed to be funny is a matter of taste though i think it is funny in a juvenile sort of way where bad taste rules the day <-1>
the humor is catered to those who like their laughs coming to them shock treatment style <0>
their alienation from society supposedly relates to those in the audience who also feel powerless about all the violence taking place in the country and now will have been amply warned by the filmmaker not to follow charismatic leaders and join cults that offer easy solutions to their problems which should give the film a conventional reason for being made <0>
{} the problem with the films message is that it comes via a film that is relying on the excesses of violence to put over its exploitive story and then to have this filmmaker be the voice of reason is almost enough to make the average citizen who is concerned about the recent shootings in americas schools and the other sensational newsworthy violent acts wonder what to make of this film or to just barf at this outlandishly childish attempt to answer some very serious problems in such a mindlessly simple way <-1>
the fatuous simplicity the film offers for linking americas penchant for violence and sex with the peoples lack of fulfillment from meaningful jobs is too much of a generality to be taken seriously <-1>
this response to what has gone wrong with the american dream is just as banal and wrongheaded a response as those who would blame films such as this one for americas problems <0>
{} at some point in the film probably as soon as the fight club was started by tyler teaching the nerd how to fight and the club was then expanded into franchises across the country and evolved into a secret society of mayhem the film stopped being smart and turned into a pointless nonsensical venture that is not serious enough to take seriously except it should be complimented for its imaginative visual style and kinetic energy it shows <-1>
{} the films undercurrent philosophical sub theme stated by tyler that its only after weve lost everything that were free to do anything is an alluring one <0>
if that were developed further along in the storyline then there would be some intellectual challenges to a film that tries very hard to be nihilistic but fails miserably to make a cogent case for that belief or whatever it is trying to say such as the drivel about this being a film about freeing the masculine soul from the shackles of a consumer society <0>
i didnt fall under brad pitt spell as easily as edward norton and helena bonham carter did and therefore was not in a receptive mood for how the film was finally resolved <-1>
by the end of the film it becomes apparent that tyler is a dangerous psychopath and that all the charm he exhibited earlier on could not hide his evil nature <0>
{} for me this was a lightweight film that mistakingly thinks its in the heavyweight class <-1>
what it offers for philosophy is similar to the kind of superficial sound bites the tv news might offer to comment on its headline stories as the news people seem to always play it safe and never take a radical position on the events they cover <-1>
what the film offers as philosophy is pseudophilosophy for a story that is more steeped in violence than interested in understanding its ramifications in a consumer society <-1>
in order words the major problem with the film is that the filmmakers position on where he stands is never broached <-1>
it is just too easy to be against the fascists and the yuppies and the emptiness of their materialistic lives <-1>
but what is the filmmakers position about the sudden violence in society other than being against the vacuous groups he lumps together <0>
exploring that avenue and not getting bogged down in showing another escapist violent film might have been a more radical route to have gone down <0>
it was very hard for me to see this unconventional mainstream film as anything more than a film that showed promise and had a lot of zip to it but was disappointing in its scope and was certainly not a radical film <-1>

[20763/b+]
{} windhorse takes us right into modern tibet and tells how the tibetans survive in a country that is not really theirs anymore <0>
it is a welldone and necessary propaganda film though even its propaganda is nuanced and made lyrical to a large extent <0>
somehow or other the world has to receive the message from the tibetans who are undergoing at the hands of their suppressors the chinese communists a policy of genocide that will probably continue unchecked unless something is done to stop it <0>
this film is one of the ways of getting out this message <0>
since tibet was invaded in by the chinese and in they forced the dalai lama to go in exile with the unbelievable explanation that they were liberating the country there have been over a million tibetans slaughtered temples ruined and over have fled the country by walking over the dangerous himalayan terrain <0>
this fictionalized drama has to be told and this serious film probably preaching to the choir cannot be judged as other films are for its entertainment value <0>
if you are seeing this film to be entertained you are in the wrong movie house though the exquisite natural beauty of the country and the entrancing holy city of lhasa and its potala the largest buddhist structure in the world offer quite a lot of sights to behold <0>
{} the brutality the tibetans are under is clearly shown as the film will tell its story as humanly as it can through the eyes of one family and it will show their hardships and disruptions to be symbolic for the sufferings of all tibetans <0>
{} the tragedy in this film starts one day in when the youngsters dorjee jampa kelsang when a grownup and his sister dolkar tibetanamerican singer dadon when a grownup and their cousin pema unnamed when a grownupwhat a shame she gave an emotionally great performance are skipping rope and dolkar is singing a childhood ballad and the siblings grandfather is suddenly taken from the house by the chinese soldiers and shot because he protested their rule by hanging a poster that said chinese get out of tibet <0>
{} the story will pick up years later when the three are grown each choosing different paths <0>
pema becomes a buddhist nun dolkar a sexy karaoke singer whose chinese boyfriend is a broadcast official named duanping richard chang helping advance her singing career as long as she performs in chinese and behaves like a lackey singing songs praising chairman mao while dorjee remains sullen unemployed wasting his time drinking beer chain smoking hanging out with his wiseguy friends in a pool hall and brooding how nothing can be done to save his country allthewhile cursing the chinese <0>
he is compelling as the weary one not knowing what to do until something tragic happens that brings out his best instincts and transforms him to do what is right <0>
he steals the picture with this gutwrenching performance <0>
{} what changes everything for the family is when pema is arrested for spontaneously screaming free tibet in the streets of the tibetan capital lhasa and is beaten to within an inch of her life and then callously returned to the family where she dies even though they tried their best to nurse her back to life in their home <0>
this travesty really hits home and shames them into actively supporting the nonviolent tibetan cause for freedom <0>
they are abetted by an american tourist amy taije silverman who speaks tibetan and has a video camera and is evidently interested in the real tibetan people <0>
{} what is simply amazing throughout the story is the gentleness of the tibetans who exhibit no violent tendencies despite all these incidents and when you compare them with the barbarian behavior of their chinese rulers you can easily see that this is a story of good vs evil <0>
{} it should be noted how the film had to be made secretly when filmed for a week in tibet most of the film was shot in nepal with a video camera and smuggled out of tibet it was shot on digital video and transferred to film and how some of the actors were in great danger and thereby could not use their real names <0>
it is easy to see why china doesnt want the truth about its human rights violations known or about the murders it commits and acts of brutality and its spy system and systematic control over its subjects or how it refuses to allow the people to even have pictures of the dalai lama in their homes arresting those that do <0>
all this being done to a people who just happen to have a philosophy of life filled with compassion and love for everyone <0>
{} the film opens and ends on a powerful spiritual note as you would expect from a people who value so highly their traditional knowledge of buddhism <0>
it shows what a windhorse is which are prayer flags on the mountain passes and scraps of paper left on the ground to be ridden by the wind into the hands of the gods for victory where each sheet of paper offers such a prayer for freedom <0>
thereby the film will rest its case that the spirit world will always be there for them <0>
{} director wagner and screenwriter tsering have pulled off a major accomplishment <0>
they made an emotional and a confrontational film and they made it inside a totalitarian chinese regime and they got away with it <0>
that makes this a very special film for me but it will probably be too onedimensional a story for those who feel it lacks the impact of dramatics and cannot forgive the film for urgently wishing to send out its message at the expense of being more artistic <1>
but i left the theater with the impression that i was watching a brave people clinging to the belief that they could find in their hearts all the goodness they need to get over this dark spot in their history <0>
i thought it was a wellmeaning film that had its exceptional moments like fully realizing the relationship of dadon and duanping as symbolic of the possible reconciliation of the two countrys <0>
these two lovers slowly come to believe that they are being duped into thinking that things could work for them in such a hostile setting and dadon realizes she cant betray her people and be lured into singing on tv for a big contract while he knows that he cant be too vocal in his protest or he will be removed from his position <0>
they both therefore must compromise their love because of current affairs <0>
{} but does the film reach an audience that doesnt know thetibetan situation <0>
{} i hope it does reach a wider american audience than what i think it will because i believe that the cause here is just the acting is firstclass the film is beautifully crafted and that all people of good faith must stand together and give hope to each other in any small or large way that they can <2>
if this fictionalized film wasnt about the real life situation in tibet and had the same mundane story i could see it being criticized for being melodramatic <0>
but since the politics of the times indicate that this film does make a difference so much so that the chinese government is doing everything in its power to ban it i therefore think that speaks volumes for how effective this film is as a political vehicle and how its cinematic importance is enhanced by the unflinching bravery of the tibetan actors and their families still living in tibet still the subject of untold horrors <0>

{} none of us know where we are going could be the theme for this road movie which is more intense and somber than most other movies of this ilk <1>
the plot is very simple a small boy and a slightly older girl want to go to their father who their greek mother told them is living in germany <0>
they dont know his name or have his address or for that matter know if he really exists yet one day they steal aboard a train and they are heading north through the greek countryside their destination being germany <0>
trains are always mysterious places for travelers they take on their own strange landscape <0>
this greek travelogue is definetly not a touristy one the itinerary is frightening the barrenness of the stations is eerie the mood is strikingly joyless as these kids are living in a dream world seeing in their dreams a father they never knew but deeply yearn for <0>
when they are caught by the conductor as possible runaways and are turned over to the authorities all they manage to say is that they are going to their uncles place <0>
it turns out that they do have an uncle in this smalltown but when he meets with the police he tells them that he cant take responsibility for these kids that his sister lied to them about their father because she didnt want to tell them that they were illegitimate <0>
the girl overhears this but refuses to believe it running away with the boy as they continue hitchhiking north <0>
{} they are picked up by a miserable truck driver and are subject to his depravity <0>
their dreamlike odyssey nevertheless continuing ever moving northward <0>
one of the more interesting and better people they meet is orestes a young man on a motorcycle a roadie for an acting troupe a loner about to go into the army <0>
he becomes a father figure to the kids his silence and mythic presence is a tower of strength to the frightened and lost kids who cant open up to him and tell him where they are going they can only tell him that they are heading north <0>
he vows to help them get on the train he sees that as his special mission <0>
his youth can be viewed in contrast to the old country dying all around him <0>
his goodness and restlessness represents the hope of the country <0>
the north represents the unknown a place of childhood fantasies <0>
{} the question asked is why carry on if you cant reach where you are going <0>
the subtle answer probably lies in what lies beyond the mist there must be something to believe in even if you cant see it <0>
{} the camera work is stupendous capturing in total the dreamlike quality of the film <2>
we witness a wedding in the snow a giant hand of creation being lifted out of the sea by a crane and the innocent kids gazing out at a world of adults that is incomprehensible to them <0>
the mood is so harsh even biblical in scope that when it asks the question in its voiceover if i were to shout who would hear me <1>
we are left speechless knowing that we are ruled by fate that the poor kids whose plight tugs at our heartstrings will not be given an easy way out of their predicament <1>
this film is not a soapy hollywood production it is a film that is meant to haunt us to make us ask questions that we cannot easily answer <2>

{} based on james jones ww novel set in guadalcanal that probes the lovehate relationship between a tough grizzly veteran sgt welsh warden and the young inexperienced pvt doll as company c makes its push to take guadalcanal from the japanese <0>
{} the idea that war is insane is the underlying theme of this violent actioner that questions the sanity of why men go to war <0>
sgt welsh prepares the men for war by picking on pvt doll unfairly accusing him of not carrying out an order even though he knows that it was carried out <0>
when capt stone daley asks why he is doing this to doll he is told that he is teaching him not to think but to obey that war is insane and that the sooner his men find this out then the better able they will be to survive in the battlefield <0>
the films title signifies the thin red line that one crosses between sanity and insanity in a war situation <0>
the captains response is that in civilian life we put men like sgt welsh in mental institutions but in war the institution we put him in is the army <0>
{} company cs immediate obstacle even before they can get used to their new war surroundings is to traverse a swamp field that is land mined and barbed wired and heavily fortified with hidden gun nests along the swampy trails and on the hilltops it is armed with machine gun dugouts <0>
the idea is to keep pushing the enemy back which means retaking all the previous villages that were taken no matter the cost in lives to the soldiers <0>
{} pvt doll is the first in his company to kill a japanese soldier and he does it savagely leaving him with permanent psychological scars <0>
doll uses the nonarmy issued pistol he stole from an american soldier to kill the japanese soldier the gun is something that he fixed in his mind that he needed to have for further protection and could not be talked out of giving it up when welsh discovered the theft <0>
dolls idea of surviving the war is a bit different than welshs he wants to know what he is doing at all times to think things through for himself to be thought of as an individual and most of all to be in charge of his own destiny <0>
{} in combat c company comes up against heavy gun fire and cant push forward <0>
the gungho col talls philbrook command to capt stone is stop worrying about casualities and take the swamp at all costs <0>
capt stone a symbol for the rational man caught in war who is trying his best to do his duty and look out for the safety of his men tells the colonel that he cant obey his command <0>
but sgt welsh comes up with a plan to mountain climb the rocky terrain with ropes for him and doll and to let the avalanche of rocks detonate the mines in the swamp <0>
when col tall appears on the scene the men are pushing ahead and the blustery colonel can only bellow what was all the fuss about <0>
the gory combat scenes and the heroics of the men and the craziness of the war are vividly photographed leaving one with a mixed impressions perhaps wondering if this is what it takes to win the battle and if that is so is it worth the price it takes to accomplish the mission <1>
the images of the dead in the swamp tagged with dogtags in their mouth was appalling to behold it is a scene that should leave one feeling a bit eerie <1>
{} the next objective is to take the village but before that next offensive can begin capt stone is summoned to the colonels headquarters and is told that he is being removed from his command because he doesnt have the stomach for battle <0>
he will be given a silver star and assigned to a rear guard desk job and nothing will go into the record about his insubordination <0>
the look on the captains face is priceless as he is stunned all the wind is taken out of him and all he could do is follow proper military courtesy over the decision fully aware that he has just been given a coveted position for something that he has actually earned but for the moment he is overcome with disappointment and regret for how he has been treated by his superior officer and by the fact that he is so suddenly being removed from the men he feels responsible for <0>
{} it is now capt gaffs gillen outfit to command and the men elated with their victory begin to celebrate by ransacking the booty the japanese soldiers left behind but their celebration is shortlived as there are a number of enemy soldiers who escaped detection and are now hidden by camouflage that blends in with the trees and their surprise attack nearly wipes out the company leaving them with only men <0>
{} heroics on the part of the men caught up in the spirit of battle begins to get the better of them as they decide to try and finish the job they were assigned climbing the top of the hill and taking out the machine gunners firing down on them <0>
doll becomes the hero going beyond the call of duty to lead the charge on the hill <0>
what results is the complete transformation of doll into a killing machine who after all his confrontational conflicts with welsh is eventually transformed into someone he didnt know he was <0>
{} this version of the thin red line is quite different from terrence malicks depersonalized one <0>
marton shot his war film by personalizing the men and simply telling of the atrocities they faced <1>
it was a straight hardnosed story with no grandiose philosophical themes <1>
its message might be read into sgt welsh last words as he is asked why did he take a bullet for someone like doll someone he didnt even like and he responds because im stupid <0>
this is a blunt statement but after all the bloody battle scenes observed and the heavy losses on both sides it is a fair question to ask and the response might not be one that can be taken literally but it is one that is wrapped around a lot of emotions that cant be articulated properly but can sure be felt <1>

[17662/b-]
{} tango is a romantic musical supposedly influenced by fellinis with political overtones to its otherwise almost mirthful mood that is for a saura film <0>
he brings back memories of the generals of argentina and their overthrow of the legitimate government emphasizing in one skit how so many people just disappeared during that regime by showing bodies thrown into a mass grave giving the film a jolt of terrifying and evocative fear that brings about an abrupt but temporary shift of mood <0>
saura accomplishes his musical numbers with a rather terse storyline which means that if you dont care for the tango you could find yourself bored with this slowmoving story <0>
what is exceptional about this film is how superbly choreographed and stunningly colorful and visionary a spectacle it is as its cinematographer is the great vittorio storaro last tango in paris <2>
saura captures the passion of the tango using mario sola as his alterego to hold his story together <1>
one of the tango masters explains to us that the tango is excellently done when experienced dancers can perform it so there is one body and four legs in motion <0>
{} mario is in his opulently decorated apartment recovering from a broken leg in a car accident as the film opens despondent that his wife laura cecilia has left him for another man presumably a younger man as far as i could tell mario must be somewhere in his forties <0>
he is busy at his desk preparing a film that he is directing about the history of argentina starting at the turn of the century <0>
in his vivid imagination he intercuts what is currently happening to him with how he saw things as a child and with what the film he is directing will be about <0>
all this imagining leaves the audience trying to figure out what is real and what is illusionary as the story revolves around his tremendous passion for the tango and his need to be with a woman who shares his zest for life as he wonders if his life has been meaningful <0>
{} he meets a yearold novice dancer through a gangster angelo galiardo who happens to be her livein boyfriend and as the main backer of the film he requests mario try her out for a part in the film <0>
he falls in love with her and is concerned but not relenting when she tells him that if she leaves angelo he threatened to do harm to her <0>
with elena in the picture he seems to be over carrying the torch for his exwife <0>
{} there is lots of innovative dancing and by mario there is lots of deep brooding thought about life and what must go into the film to make it arty <1>
we see see a wind machine and the next thing we see is a sultry tango being performed sets are designed out of seemingly thin air there are color filters for dance numbers created on the spot a west side story look alike number is shown with all male dancers <0>
{} the dancing is good enough to carry this film alone <2>
the tango is danced with passion by everyone especially graceful were the two women stars and the great tango dancer julio bocca <2>
but the story thats another story it just didnt seem that important including the nebulous surprise ending which in actuality detracted even further from the slight storyline <-1>
the only scene of dialogue that i thought was really welldone was when mario was on a dinner date with elena and was trying to explain and sell himself to her telling her how he thought like a young man <-1>
he was eventually able to do this by just being himself after trying to use a few farfetched analogies comparing men to women that didnt seem to go over with her <0>
{} the mood the musical numbers set was so convincingly dreamlike that for someone like me who was born with two left feet i felt like going to a ballroom and trying this elegant dance even if i never danced the tango before <2>
the dancing remains in my head and that is what cinema can do to you when it is so stunning to behold <2>

{} the always obstreperous ken russell the music loverslistomaniatommy has come up with a wonderfully impetuous freudianlike biography on turnofthecentury austrian musical conductor and composer gustave mahler robert powell who obsessively plays him with proper conviction <2>
the troubled life of the neurotic jewish composer who converted to catholicism to appease the antisemites in austria especially the powerful voice of cosima wagner antonia ellis so he can gain career advantages is powerfully covered by russell elaborately using a series of tableaux to get into the maestros head and into his music and into his perplexing marriage with alma georgina hale who is played by her with a succinct elegance <0>
{} dreams and fits of anguish interspersed with flashbacks to his pressured upbringing by his pedlar bohemian father who demanded he succeed for the familys honor and then to further flashbacks of other important events in his creative life enthrall this biopic with strong emotional feelings that make it clear that mahler was someone who struggled with his musical genius as he kept hearing music inside himself as well as his struggle with his hostile surroundings always the outsider and with a wife who told him you have succceeded in taking the tunes out of me <0>
{} the film opens with the kind of excessive dream sequence one comes to expect from russell where the composers house on the lake is in flames and his wife is tightly wrapped in white linen struggling to free herself from the garb and is crawling on the rocks to a bust of mahler which she embraces <-1>
mahler tells his wife that the dream which she did not look kindly upon thinking it was just another one of the ways he always uses to put her in place but to him it was actually a homage to her as he tells her she is the living creature struggling to be born <0>
his bust on the rock he says signifies that i was the rock and the rock was me <0>
the visionary dream is evocative of the music he created for the st movement of the third sympathy as it is heard and interpreted by russell in a way that is highly complimentary to a composer whom he obviously admires flawed personality not withstanding <0>
{} we pick up the mahlers on their last train ride before his death where the famous composer of ten symphonies nine numbered is returning from a conducting stint at new yorks metropolitan opera with arturo toscanini after hostility fomented by sections of the press forced his resignation in from his prestigious conducting postion at the vienna state opera <0>
from a reporter who boards the train we learn that mahler might have been forced to leave thevienna state opera because of antisemtism though mahler claims he left for a change of environment and is returning for the same reason <0>
he also emphatically says i conduct to live i live to conduct indicating that it is his composing that makes life interesting for him as he contemptuously dismisses the reporter <0>
{} as a timid child he meets a puckish sort of man in the woods pickup who saves him from drowning and teaches him an invaluable lesson about music the man who doesnt live in nature cant write a true note of music <0>
mahler sees his compositions as a tribute to the music of the spheres and for him a symphony is a farewell to love <0>
when asked what religion are you by a smug army officer named max richard morant who is a suitor of his wife he replies im a composer <0>
{} what gives the film force and a sense of inspired madness and makes this a work the musical aficionado might question regarding its authenticity but the film buff might applaud for its richness of visuals are a few very inventive scenes <0>
at a mental institution he visits his dear friend and fellow student at thevienna conservatory who cracked up hugo wolfe collins <0>
he addresses hugo as his majesty and from this charade he is grilled by the lunatic accepting him as if he were the real emperor franz joseph and comes away from this visit realizing that he can only get places musically if he converts since his religion is holding him back in this antisemitic milieu <0>
the conversion scene becomes the most powerful and outlandish one in the film as it is filmed as if were a silent movie changing to a talkie at the moment of the conversion <1>
this scene comes on so strong as to drown out any other attempt by russell to have a more subdued film than he usually shoots for <1>
there are symbols galore of crosses jewish stars nazi insignias money and fire gods <0>
cosima is depicted as a nazi and he as a willing servant of hers prepared to go into a cave and slay the dragon of the old gods to gain her appproval as she smilingly tells him when he has slain the dragon you are no longer a jew you are now one of us <0>
he will then eat the nonkosher pig meat and drink a glass of milk with it completing his conversion <0>
{} after his real conversion he will say it reminded him of having a toothache <0>
for mahler man is his own god and god shares his love with us all <0>
but this conversion affected him greatly and continued to eat away at his famished psyche already terribly damaged from a childhood of constant nagging <0>
{} always insecure and troubled never happy always irritable and petulant a most unpleasant person and a sexist but a musical genius is the impression of mahler that russell convincingly leaves us with <0>
as mahler in despite of his pettiness bravely tells his wife choose between me and max but do not choose me because of duty duty always destroys <0>
the choice in marriage must always be love <0>
in a film that plays at times like a soap opera story of a beautiful wife who learns to live with her genius husband as the husband and wife fight for their beliefs and for their love <0>
but it is the music of mahler that is refreshingly digested admittedly a music for acquired tastes but a music that i most heartily appreciated that gives the film its resonance <2>
the film also plays like viscontis death in venice gone astray where homoerotic shots are coupled with coarse heterosexual shots <0>
the passion of mahlers germanic symphonies evincing childlike deathcries from his renown th symphony as coincidentally one of his little girls died soon afterwards and he received one of his many heart attacks after the symphony was completed <0>
which result for russell a director who has proven himself to be a music lover who knows how to be flamboyant and controversial into making a film that was very impressive <1>
though the film like mahlers music is clearly not for everyone <0>

{} clay pigeons tried hard to be a pleasant comedysuspense story about a serial killer and a character study of some small town denizens and the outsider fbi agents <0>
it worked reasonably well for part of the film as dead bodies came popping up unexpectedly in this sleepy montana town but then the story ran out of tricks and everything about the film fell apart and the psychopathic woman hating slasher lester long vaughn became a tiresome charge his maniacal charm just wore out his welcome on screen and the films conclusion lacked tension or purpose and seemed to be a wasted effort as it just simply ran out of gas after about an hour into it <-1>
{} since its a story about clay pigeons with the singular dictionary meaning for that slang term a person in a situation where he can be taken advantage of by others the clay pigeon is the towns auto mechanic clay birdwell phoenix considered by the locals to be a nice guy who is out target shooting with his best friend earl sporleder when earl confronts him with the news that his wife amanda coates told him she is making love to him and earl tells him i cant live with that <0>
earl comes up with this crazy idea of shooting himself in the leg and then killing himself while framing it so that clay would be accused of the crime and have to serve prison time <0>
clay tells this to the sexy amanda after earl carries out his plan as we see her dressed in a see throughnightgown wearing only red panties <0>
but she tells clay hes on his own she wants no one to know about her relationship with him <0>
our flawed hero then tows earls pickup with him in it and has it go down a hill to explode and when his friend the unassuming sheriff mooney scott comes to investigate he fails to tell him the whole truth <0>
{} while playing a mean game of pool in a place aptly named doc holidays clay meets an enigmatic and garrulous cowboy clad in full cowboy gear including a fancy stetson <0>
the cowboy lester long is a stranger in town and is impressed that clay slapped amanda when she tried to seduce him by the pool table <0>
a friendship between the two develops leading to a fishing expedition where a womans body stabbed times is discovered floating in the water <0>
{} a fatal friendship also develops between lester and amanda as she will later on be killed by the psychopath <0>
{} but first the story gets more twisted and unbelievable when clay refuses to see amanda anymore and has sex with a waitress nikki he picksup <0>
she is shot while in the middle of her sexual climax with him by the jealous and deranged amanda knowing clay is not in a position to squeal <0>
he is forced to also dispose of this body which he dumps in the local lake <0>
{} into the picture comes the fbi led by the wryhumored agent dale shelby janeane garofalo and the efficientlooking agent reynard morris who are looking at clay as a possible serial killer <0>
there have been seven other dead bodies turning up all over montana that the fbi believes to be the work of one serial killer <0>
what garofalo brought to the film at this point was some welcomed comic relief much needed because this film was exhausted from all the contrivances and lack of adequate character study it provided <0>
it was only through garofolos sense of black comedy that the film was still bearable and at that it was only barely bearable <-1>
{} clay is somewhat of an innocent at least as far as the murders go but he certainly cant be commended for being a truthful person <0>
{} everything gets resolved in the films anticlimax that mercifully ends in an arrest though some minutes too late as far as im concerned <0>
what might be likable about this film to viewers not that discerning about plot or character study is that this film was user friendly and brought about a hearty guffaw or two <0>
none of the actors was bad bad but none were memorable <0>
its one of those films that is easily forgotten <-1>

{} paris as it was in for the lost generation of americans hemingway gertrude stein alice b toklas and all the other artists and would be artists seeking to make their name known on foreign soil <0>
rudolph takes a rather cynical and tongueincheek view of that art scene capturing the mood and the atmosphere of that period shooting this highly entertaining and for him accessible film in a dazzling display of color representative of the art produced at that time by picasso cezanne matisse and modigliani <1>
this was actually the first feature film he had in mind but had to wait to do it until he got backers <0>
his love and understanding of this time period shows up very well as a result he creates his best film to date <1>
{} the plot of the film concerns love heartbreak money problems the meaning of art alcoholism and finding ones identity <0>
nick hart carradine is the cartoonist for the chicago tribune living in a garret frequenting the parisian expatriate cafes trying to sell the paintings he works on with all his artistic skills and earning extra money by forging the paintings of the masters <0>

{} when nick sees the beautiful wife he never divorced rachel linda in a paris bar married to the ruthless and crass business man manufacturer of condoms and private art collector bertram lone he tries to win her back <0>
she is dissipated unhappy with the direction of her life becoming an alcoholic and ashamed that she is married to a very cruel and despicable man <0>
{} libby bujold is a smalltime art dealer who tries unsuccessfully to sell nicks paintings <0>
nathalie de ville chaplin is the insincere art collector wife of a husband that she cheats on while also hiring nick to forge three of her philandering husbands collection of masters for the nefarious purpose of getting even with him <0>
the parisian scene is topped off by an emotionally sentimental hemingway oconnor showing up at all the right parties sitting at the right cafes drinking to excess and plying his craft while thinking aloud as his philosphy comes off as just so much drivel with him appearing shallow and hopelessly american despite his presence in paris at precisely the right time for an american to be there <0>
gertrude stein elsa and her friend alice ali come off as snobs in love with their own sense of selfimportance <0>
{} though the story might falter at times with unneeded boxing matches and stereotyped tourists providing unneeded insights into the parisian scene what never faltered was how well this film looked and how engagingly it caught the ironies of that period <2>

{} a chain letter is mysteriously started after an office worker is choked to death by a guy in a red ski mask with a piece of string who steals the letters and then mails some of them <0>
what then transpires is a whacky and i do mean whacky story not unlike a conspiracy theory as it offers comments on violence sibling rivalries paranoia on both heterosexual and gay relationships and reasons why we shouldnt trust our government <1>
using the example of how it lied about the agent orange use on our soldiers during the vietnam war and how the government has secret projects that it uses on the unsuspecting public to do its unsavory experiments on as these letters interconnect with the lives of diverse characters who some how or other connect with each other <0>
{} this is a mark rappaport film so if you are expecting to see a convential film you have walked into the wrong theater <0>
his tongueincheek humor is as always delightfully absurd <2>
all characters play costarring roles with no one dominating the film <0>
and it works in an odd sort of way making the characters seem connected to each other from the opening strangulation scene until the last scene even though there is no mention ever made in the movie again of the opening murder <1>
{} this is a film about troubled characters and a chance for rappaport to direct his weird humor into the inanely funny lines spoken by them as each character is out of it in a neurotic way <1>
the characters appear in short skits trying to relate to each other in bursts of energy spewing out lame jokes and theories selfabsorbed with their own neurotic tendencies while many of them are hungering for sex and violence and answers to puzzles that they may not even be working on <0>
paul mark is seen at a wall map discussing with beth randy a ww movie he saw believing everything is planned out in life by a series of dots and life is simple if we can just understand the plan which is right under our noses as it should have been for the nazi general depicted in the film he saw last night <0>
he plays the part of a guy with a screw loose after his vietnam war days who likes to screw women and play out his paranoia until it is real <0>
beth thrives on sex <0>
she is also seeing pauls brother phil david who is a college teacher expounding in the lecture she attends about sharks who have within them eggs called ovaphagos which devour their own brothers in the womb <0>

greg reed is also aboard the same train car and is gay but he also services ladies and is not known to steve but he is the paid stud for steves exwife concerned about aging eva ellen who works as a research scientist who has previously dated phil as her interest in phil is rekindled through the chain letter received <0>
eva and beth are sisters <0>
greg through the courtesy of the chain letter makes contact with phil telling him that he knows that phil secretly wants to have a gay affair which phil acknowledges just wondering how greg detected that about him since he believes that he has so carefully disguised that fact about himself <0>
{} steve meets a former soap teenage star tracy marilyn in the supermarket who is living with the macho gun toting black motorcycle jacketed rick robert who looks like greg and by coincidence greg has met on the street believing he might be secretly gay and has struck up a friendship with hoping they can at least be best friends <0>
{} steve has sex with the outspoken tracy and is presented with a tshirt that matches hers if it isnt stiff it isnt worth a fuck as the sophisticated steve reluctantly dons it to walk with her on the street where he surprisingly runs into the woman he was attracted to on the subway evelyn who turns out to be tracys sister a sister that she cant stand <0>
after tracy rips up the phone number her sister gives her steve takes it from her and reassembles it to call evelyn for a date <0>
after their date turns out to be cordial but with no sex in the offering they part ways with a handshake and on the street rick guns down greg because greg has left him and paul who hates steve thinking he is having an affair with his evelyn spots them together in the same street where greg is shot so he uses a high powered rifle to kill steve from the building he has positioned himself on getting a nod of approval from rick <0>
{} that should cover enough of the plot for any one who needs to know what he is seeing before he determines if he should venture out to rent this on video <0>
all i could honestly say is that i enjoyed it <2>
it was like a nice cold drink on a hot summer day offering me something for my thirst as i wonder why there is not a greater market for original films like this one after all the plot of this film is not completely insane <2>
and as paul so ably says everything is a plot it is just not clear what it is <0>

{} an independent film shot for around that lacks a cutting edge something indie films should not leave home without <-1>
it sure looks like a hollywood studio film to me but with a little bit of spice thrown in to give it some oomph <1>
it is a story about swingers which should be a revolting topic and is for most of the film nevertheless there is humor to be found <1>
the boys are out to have some fun all wrapped up in their libidos ready to score with the opposite sex <0>
the gang is made up of actors looking for work coming to hollywood to be where the action is <0>
the star of the film is the one who wrote the screenplay jon favreau mike who plays this whiny exnew yorker who wants to be a standup comedian but is the only one of his swinger friends who is not funny he is instead disconsolate because he left his honey months ago to be in lala land jumpstarting his comic career <0>
he now feels lost without her finding every other chick he meets to be no match for her <0>
unfortunately we have to hear this whining for most of the film until he acts natural and bingo something good happens to this dude who i must fess up and say i felt nothing at all for <-2>
{} that girls are attracted to the swingers speaks volumes for how sex and love are intertwined in our culture <0>
and the boys will be boys theme is played here to the hilt as sex is always foremost on their mind <0>
for mike it has to be both sex and love <0>
that he is clearly the winner at the end gives the film the right perspective it needs not to fall into its own cool lingo trap <0>
{} preoccupied with himself mike always thinks he is being sensitive even when telling the girls he means it when he says how much he misses his babe so naturally he fails to attract their interest <0>
in contrast the swingers that make up his group roam las vegas the bars of l a and the home parties they get invited to with a steel will for scoring as many chicks as they can <0>
{} mikes best pal is trent vince <0>
he sets the tone for the boys <0>
encouraging them when they are down but he is caught in his own deceits vainly thinking he can pickup any girl he wants <0>
he represents the heart and soul of the swingers and gives the film a comedic tone that at times as silly as it is is downright funny <1>
i loved his philosophical advice to mike from one swinger to another advising him that you cannot get a woman to come back unless youre willing to forget her after which of course you dont care if she comes back <1>
it is also riotous to hear the loud mouth trent call mike money every time he wants to cheer his pal up <0>
the other swingers are rob ron livingston sue patrick van horn yes sue is a boy and charles alex desert who act to support each other looking out for mike in particular thinking he desperately needs to get his head together in order to be back with them swinging <0>
{} what irked me most about the film was how the filmmakers seemed proud that they ripped off tarantinos style of film claiming everyone rips off everyone else <-2>
the problem with that logic is that this film doesnt look original it looks and feels like all those other tarantino clones <-1>
it smacks of wannabe actors being made into a film by wannabe directors and writers <-1>
{} if you have a strong stomach and can take the staleness of the story <-2>
you might find it funny enough and actually enjoy it realizing in all seriousness that this is the way it is for many heterosexuals and it is always hard to change the way it is no pun intended <1>

{} french new wave cinema at its best <2>
chabrols second feature film weaves an enigmatic moral fable of good and evil as the mamas boy the college student from the country charles gerard who is studying law while he stays with his philistine playboy cousin paul brialy who seems to be a student of parties living as luxuriously as a student can in paris <0>
{} we see this film through charles naive eyes who cant believe what he is seeing <0>
but it is paul who takes center stage having a tremendous facility for socializing and meeting attractive girls while he shows little interest or respect for the academics reducing his reading to detective stories or pornography <0>
he does enjoy wagners music as he uses that music and the superficial conversations he has with the other students to convey a certain sophistication about life that he does not really have <0>
he is especially adept in his ability to bluff people into thinking that he a person of substance <0>
he also exhibits shall we say bad taste as he frightens a jewish student in his sleep by mimicking a gestapo agent <0>
{} yet it is paul who achieves success with the things many young people seem to value such as having many friends many sexual conquests a car material things and a very active social life despite his disdain for people <0>
while his supposedly wellbehaved cousin seems befuddled in this environment wanting to live a quality life but instead living like a leper <0>
he reads balzac respects women wants to marry a nice girl and is only too happy to please his mother by doing well in college <0>
in otherwords chabrol makes him out to be a loser and a square someone who has no inspiration for living <0>
a rather pathetic creature whose goodness turns chabrols stomach <0>
no matter how impure a picture chabrol paints of paul and his dissolute lifestyle paul has energy and is on the road to success <0>
charles is unable to find himself by doing what is conventionally right such as burying himself in books and class work <0>
he does not seem to come any closer to finding a way out of the moralistic trap he has built for himself <0>
when he shows disdain to pauls older college buddy the rakish clovis cerval he is reacting to his bourgeois way of looking at things <0>
and when he falls in love at firstsight with florence juliette he shows no discernment expecting everything to be just what he thinks it is and when his nice girl turns out to be a slut who leaves him for paul he is crushed not knowing how to adequately express himself to anyone his age or to communicate with his peers what he sees as problematic ethics for their generation <0>
but he does talk to the older bookstore owner someone he feels a kinship with as they both profess to being book lovers and are scornful of the flippant attitudes of the other students with the older man acting as a surrogate father for the student who is desperately in need of advise <0>
{} there is a great camera shot of charles trying to enter a closed church after his breakup with florence and in the next instant we see the camera pan to the open door of the bookstore where paul finds it easy to talk to the owner of the bookshop and get his girl trouble off his chest <1>
but he is disappointed when the bookstore owner can only tell him that if his problem is only about a girl thats no big deal <0>
he will get over it <0>
this all seems like logical advise something we kind of expect a sympathetic parent to say to a hurt child <0>
but for paul this is no little problem it is an insurmountable problem and he feels let down by the response <0>
chabrol has carefully painted a picture indicating that there is no help in sight for those who need it whether from the pillars of society or from the rebels <0>
{} warning spoiler to follow <0>
skip the next paragraph if you dont want to know how the film ends and proceed to the last paragraph <0>
{} the good charles fails his college exams while the badly behaved paul passes the exam and throws a rousing farewell party to celebrate <0>
this is too much for charles to comprehend and while paul is sleeping he points a loaded pistol at his head but changes his mind <0>
when paul awakens from his drunken slumber while fooling around with the pistol thinking it is unloaded as it always is he fires it and accidentally kills his cousin <0>
{} chabrols film would be interesting enough just for its depiction of parisian student life but when he moves into grounds of philosophical ethics and questions what love is to those who think they have fallen in love his concepts become challenging intellectual engagements <1>
the film questions the institutions and the people who have trust in them and ones own morality <0>
this thriller becomes a matter of how one comes to terms with ones ability and how society is based on the principle of the survival of the fittest <0>
it is chabrols rather cynical but fair look at how parisian society operates and how young people suffer from the pangs of youth sometimes even in a deadly manner <1>

[22222/c]
{} a b film psychological thriller from the novel by stefan zweig that runs out of thrills eventually and ends on a flat note but for a while it had its exhilarating moments of suspense <1>
it tells the story of an austrian noblemanintellectual werner von basil jurgens who is held as a prisoner in his native austria at the outset of ww <0>
the nobleman has helped bishop ambros snker store the churchs treasured art collection in a hidden place and refuses to tell the nazi conquerors where those valuable treasures can be found <0>
{} the story is told in flashback as the freed but shaken nobleman is taken by his eminence and safely placed on board a boat heading for new york <0>
the flashbacks intercut between his present voyage and the ordeal of his brainwashing at the hands of the gestapo <0>
{} the flashbacks begin at a party as he meets the treacherously beautiful austrian ballerina irene andreny bloom who is escorted by the new third reich minister of culture to austria hans berger felmy <0>
that night he is arrested by the young nazi who pretends to be an intellectual and is determined to use his methods of brainwashing to get the information he needs out of werner without resorting to physical torture <0>
he locks him in a small creaky unbecoming room that is bare and allows no one to talk to him while he feeds him a daily diet of stale bread <0>
it is a test of wills to see who will give in first <0>
if berger fails there is hartmann lieven his superior who awaits with the oldfashioned torture methods <0>
{} somehow werner steals a book on how the masters play chess and even though he has never played the game before he memorizes all the moves in that book as a means of keeping sane <0>
after seven weeks go by he still hasnt cracked and irene fed up with her nazi boyfriend breaks up with him and tries to add moral support to werner in his effort to survive <0>
{} the scene on the boat brings back conflicting memories for werner as there is a pompous master chess champion mirko centrowic who reminds him of his former captors and is playing against a group of amateurs <0>
werner cant help himself from entering the game and it is the first time in his life he has played chess but he of course beats the champion <0>
{} the acting by everyone but jurgens was horrid <-2>
the story made no great impression on me but it was curious to watch how someone can handle isolation by concentrating on the intricacies of a game he doesnt really understand <0>
overall the film was just passable entertainment nothing more <1>

[18068/a]
{} this is the first film made under the label of dogma a scandinavian film group inspired by the danish director von trier which insists that their new manifesto on how to make films be adhered to by those who make films under their label <0>
{} this dogma consists of improvised acting and handheld camera work among other dogmas the film must adhere to <0>
it reminds me most of how godard filmed during his mao stage but without the apparent overt political messages as godards films during the late s were antifilm films replete with diatribes against the bourgeoisie which seemed filled with the directors hubris and selfcongratulation on his political stance that he was right and others wrong in their beliefs and his rather tiresome political cliches that seemed to be more opportunistic than spontaneous even though every attempt was to make the film appear as if they were spontaneous <-2>
{} trier has a bunch of middleclass cult groupies living together in a rich private house that one of their relatives gave them as the group members seem to be either in their late teens or their s whose repulsive purpose is to freak out in public and sometimes do it when together in the privacy of their house <0>
to spasse is a danish term which refers to those who act like idiots even though they are not <0>
these episodes of spassing give this film an odd look that is guaranteed to turn off a lot people and anger many especially those who expect more conventional ways of looking at the problems young people face in society <0>
{} the theme of the movie is certainly obnoxious <-1>
it is very difficult to feel much of anything for these middleclass dropouts as we first encounter them in action in an elegant restaurant and watch them spasse retardedly eating their food under the direction of one of them susanne who pretends to be their keeper while one of them stoffer grabs on to a lady karen sitting alone and refuses to let go of her <0>
karen seems to be responding kindly to the idiot just like she didnt react with any ill emotion after being treated rather brusquely by the waiter when she told him she doesnt have much money and will be just ordering the salad <0>
the group leaves together with karen and tells her it is just a game they enjoy playing inviting her to join them even though she does not appear like they do but she does look desperate and lonely and unhappy and might benefit from hanging around with such idiots as they are <0>
{} they do another spassing in a rockwood furniture factory which was more stupid than humorous and belabored any point that was trying to be made about workers in a factory or about middleclass values it was goofy in a way to watch them operate as it seemed to be similar to the way that fraternities might find their inane initiation rites uplifting to their older members who already went through the initiation process to join the group but to outsiders it would seem like they were seeing a bunch of spoiled children <-1>
{} in another public spassing jeppe is left by the one playing his keeper stoffer with a burly looking bunch of tattooed beer guzzling biker types who are asked to mind him for ten minutes after they notice jeppe staring at their tattoos while the keeper goes to the other part of the bar <0>
again it was not funny but yet it was curiously interesting in a prurient kind of way to see what the interaction was going to be between these two groups of outcasts <1>
{} the most controversial part of the film is the sex orgy among the group members acting as idiots and actually seeming to copulate on camera porno stars were used to do the sex sort of giving the film a mock documentary feel to it as the orgy members smear caviar all over their faces and try to unbend from the middleclass environment they all came out of <0>
the tenderest love making was between the teenager josephine and the older jeppe who really seemed to be falling for each other but could only do it under the cover of being idiots <0>
soon josephines father would embarrass her by coming to the groups home and removing her from the home <0>
{} the film moved into the gist of the filmmakers message when stoffer the leader of the group decided he would spin a bottle and whomever was chosen would have to spasse in front of family members or those they previously worked with <0>
axel and henrik could not do it and thereby left the group <0>
what was becoming increasingly clear was that the game was almost over for all of them that they couldnt really confront the idiot inside themselves that it was becoming apparent to them that it was just a temporary game they were playing perhaps in an experimental phase of their young life <0>
{} i think the point that von trier was trying to make is that you really have to be an idiot to change the system or think that you can change it but that you can only be effective when you really confront who you are reaching past the point of where authority rules who you are or else you are stuck with the same cultural values you have always had and cant really change who you have been brought up as <0>
being an idiot is the last act of despair <0>
it is an act of courage <0>
and it only matters when you can do it for real and not be using it to play a game <0>
for von trier being an idiot is an endearing way at looking at someone acting out who he is in order to initiate change in the system <0>
{} karens story now unfolds and she turns out to be the one with the most dramatic thing to tell about her life <0>
she volunteers to go back home to do her spassing with susanne as her witness <0>
we meet her family who act cold towards her asking her where she has been for the last two weeks and wondering why she didnt go to her babys funeral <0>
we meet her husband who shows her no love and then we see her spasse on her cream cake after dinner acting as her baby might have acted when eating the cake and she gets slapped by her husband and leaves the house with susanne who is filled with genuine tears <0>
the trauma for her has reached a point of no return and the very dangers of spassing or regressing back to ones childhood to find a way of dealing with a society you are antagonistic to seems frought with extreme personal dangers and the possiblity of a psychosis developing looms over all the young peoples heads <0>
{} trier has made his point <1>
he has won me over <2>
this very unusual personal film that is very difficult to warm up to that mocks what is conventionally thought of as right by doing what is unconscionable and politically incorrect becomes only too real and too sad to comprehend as it is presented so as not to give us a way out in our perception of how to deal with the alienation the youngsters feel as they seem to be left with only their naive hopes and disillusionments and possibly their emotional experiences that they can value <2>
their situation is not resolved <0>
the film does not end with all loose ends tied up in a nice bow <0>
we cant even be sure how long their commune life will continue and how soon it is that they will find themselves out in the cold world alone again as misfits where some of them will fit in without too much trouble but will be living a lie and where others will find it very difficult to go back to being middleclass and will always be restless in such a society <0>
but they tried something <0>
and whether they reached their innerself or not something penetrated them whether they are the better for this experience is difficult to tell but something significant to them did take place just as we in the audience whether we liked the film or not something inside us was moved by what we saw taking place causing us to react in a way we might not normally act when watching a film <1>
and in my way of thinking that is great filmmaking <2>

[17398/b]
{} dark city is a sci finoir thriller that portends to deliver a message relating to the powers of the mind and the meaning of identity <0>
everything attempted here has been done before but that still doesnt take away from the films feeling of looking like it is an original <2>
credit must go to the creative use of special effects and the outstanding set designs used for its bedimmed city <2>
{} the film opens with the protagonist sewell waking up in a tub in a hotel room with a murdered prostitute <0>
he is suspected of being the serial killer who is plaguing the city <0>
and since he is not sure if he did it or not he has a dazed look on his puss like he will have throughout the entire film <0>
just then he receives a call from sutherland who displays the crazed mannerisms of a nazi type of a doctor those more concerned about their inhuman experiments than the treatment of their patients <0>
sewell is warned to get out of there immediately and sure enough there are strange creatures who are called strangers coming after him <0>
the police are also in pursuit they suspect sewell of being the serial killer they are looking for <0>
hurt is the deadpan hard nosed type of movie cop you would see in a s noir film leading the investigation <0>
{} the strangers we are told in the voice over that begins the film are humanlike aliens from another planet who have altered the memories of everyone in this city and have changed everyones identity so that no one really knows who is who <0>
they just assume the identity that is secretly given to them <0>
the strangers have forced sutherland who is not a stranger into working for them to inject a serum into those whose identities are being changed <0>
the city remains dark at all times and at midnight everyone becomes unconscious <0>
somehow sewell slipped through the cracks of the strangers and even though he has no idea of who he is he knows he cant be a murderer <0>
he will become from now on the source of our information about what the strangers are all about <0>
he will be on the run for the remainder of the film innocent though he may be just like a protagonist in earlier noir films questioning authority and trying to pull himself together unsure of whom to trust <0>
his visit to the automat brought back pleasant memories of my childhood in nyc but this automat was cheerless and cold only its bright lights served as a sharp contrast to the dark eeriness of this city <0>
{} sewell fingers a postcard with a serene picture of shell beach on it that he has found in his pocket <0>
shell beach seems important to him but he doesnt know why <0>
he sees it advertised on billboards all over town but when he asks directions to go there no one can tell him how to get there <0>
through sewells interminable questioning of everything he begins to unravel what is going on <0>
he finds out that the strangers have telekinetic powers enabling them to put people to sleep by focusing on them they can also fly and go through walls and do mind control tricks <0>
he also finds out that they came to earth because they were slowly dying out they have no individuality they only live unconsciously <0>
what they want to find on earth is how humans live as individuals what makes them think and what is a soul <0>
they came to do experiments on humans using them as if they were guinea pigs <0>
sewell was made to be a murderer and studied to see how a murderer acts before he got away from their clutches <0>
{} sewell has trouble decifering what is real <0>
he questions his wife jennifer whom he does not even know and she tells him that she had an affair with someone else <0>
he falls in love with her anyway and the message of the film becomes only too clear it is in the heart that the individual is born and the heart cant be dissected and experimented with like a science blinded by technology and ignorant of the imagination <0>
{} proyas has created a visually challenging movie that is backed up by some thoughtful ideas <2>
it is the kind of film that ufoers and alien watchers will tell ya see i told you there was life out there in space <1>
but to others this is still only pedestrian stuff it is not the real deal <-1>
and the flat acting did not add anything positive to the story <-1>
i enjoyed the film for its ambience and for the creative mood it set <2>
but what diminished its positives was how the main purpose of the actors seemed to be to spout robotic messages for the characters they were portraying <-1>
i wished that proyas had enough confidence to allow his visions to do the talking <-1>

{} one of the all time fun pictures with enough ingredients in it to please a wide variety of film fans <2>
james whale the director of frankenstein saying this one is his favorite film <0>
this was english actor claude rains american movie debut and vehicle to future stardom even though he is visible for probably less than seconds of the film and that comes only at the films climax who only got the role because boris karloff turned it down afraid that the role wouldnt work for him because he wouldnt be seen <0>
but rains distinctive voice was all that was needed to bring credibility to the part he will always be remembered for <1>
a film so perfectly and magically done that is based on the h g wells novel that is faithful to the book while adding its own flavor of campiness to the story such as a wonderfully bizarre una oconnor screaming her head off as the lions head inns wife of the owner and hostess to the invisible man <2>
{} a special film such as this one brings unmitigated joy to those of the th century who like to sit in the dark and watch a world of illusions come across a screen an activity that could have hardly been envisioned a couple of thousand years ago and is looked upon even today with a strange reserve by those who dont take their movies that seriously not understanding just how rewarding it is for those who find certain films so important to them that it becomes an integral part of their life and they can see the same film over and over again and still derive great satisfaction in what they are seeing <2>
as for me i could have seen this film as many as twenty times already starting when i was yearsold and first saw it on a tv program called the million dollar movie and i still get a kick out of it and see something delightfully new in it with each viewing <2>
it is especially fun to watch it with youngsters who have never seen it before and are generally unfamiliar with watching a movie in bw just to watch the reaction you get from these youngsters is enough of a charge as they are perhaps surprised at the fun they are having in watching such a creaky story and its outdated hollywood version of an old established english country village <2>
it is a film like this one that can lure you into becoming a bona fide film buff <2>
{} in the snow a mysterious stranger rains enters the village inn and seeks a room <0>
he is dressed so you cant see one feature of him as he is wrapped in facial bandages and wearing a hat and an overcoat rubber gloves and sun goggles <0>
the patrons at the bar think he is an escaped convict <0>
the owner of the inn forrester is upset that he hasnt paid his bill and is rude to his wife una who wants her husband to get rid of the strange guest who has turned his room into a science lab and is scaring away the other customers <0>
the stranger who is the scientist jack griffin just wants to be left alone <0>
he ran to this nearby village when he realized the experiment that he was working on for the last years went wrong and he had become invisible after using a drug called monocaine which is a flour grown in india that has the effect of a bleaching power but has powerful side effects when ingested such as megalomania and permanent invisibility <0>
it was his hope that he could buy some time in this village inn to find a formula for becoming visible again <0>
{} the gifted director james whale knew what to do with this story as his serious sounding but humorous caveat throughout the film is there are certain things on earth man must not meddle in <1>
{} when the police are called in to remove the inns guest who wouldnt budge there is a mixture of suspense and tongueincheek humor in the air as griffin unwraps his bandages and to the utter amazement of the policeman and the other bar patrons becomes invisible running around the room undetected by them tweaking them mocking them and providing one of the all time great scenes in film history <2>
he goes through the village playing childish pranks stealing hats off the men and riding a bike invisibly through the streets <0>
it is only the police chief who is cynical about this refusing to believe what the people are reporting to him <0>
{} griffin feels he needs a visible partner to help him with this maddening plan he has to rule the world by initiating a reign of terror so he visits his scientific colleague dr kemp harrigan who is his hated rival and a man of low character who wishes to steal griffins wife away from him upon learning of his disappearance a week ago flora gloria whose father travers is the scientist that both of them work under <0>
dr kemp is scared outofhis wits <0>
and the scene is filled with pathos melodrama and ironical wit <1>
as griffin dresses in his unwilling guests robe and pajamas and usual bandage disguise and explains to him that his invisibilty is not perfect after eating his food it could be seen for an hour afterwards until it is fully digested that in the cold air you could see his breath in the rain he would look like a bubble that he has trouble walking down stairs as an invisible man because he hasnt quite gotten used to the fact that he is invisible and therefore is very cautious of the downward steps he takes <0>
but he tells kemp not to fret for him these are minor problems that will be worked out in due time and besides on a clear day conditions are perfect for him <0>
{} he makes kemp come with him back to the lions head where he left his invaluable notes <0>
once there he comes across a meeting being held to determine if the invisible man isnt a hoax as the police chief insists discounting all the claims the locals are making <0>
this angers the invisible man so he slays the chief and is now the subject of an intense manhunt <0>
{} but how do you capture an invisible man <0>
whale has a ball with this police problem <0>
{} when the invisible man discovers police all around kemps house he realizes kemp tried to doublecross him and promises to kill kemp at exactly p m tomorrow <0>
this bizarre threat adds to the mystique of the invisible one as the police believe they have set a fool proof trap for their man using kemp as bait <1>
{} the film comes to its splendid climax in the dreaded snow with john fultons ultramodern for its day special effects adding enormous visual support to the scifi story having the invisible mans footprints remarkably appear in the snow <2>

[18004/a]
{} this is a noir film one of the last ones shot that can truly emulate the spirit of the ones shot in the heyday of american noir in the s and the s <2>
melville shoots in a dark color tone that sets the dire mood of the violent story about a prison escape a heist a doublecross and the untrustworthy nature of people <0>
melville wanted to make a french version of john hustons noir classic the asphalt jungle as melville imbued in his film his strong beliefs about what a gangster picture should look like making it original while covering all the subplots of that genre he could manage to fit into a film that runs for minutes <1>
this is a transitional film as it makes way for a new wave of crime films to follow ones that will reflect the changing mores of society and the changes within the criminal code that the new decade brings with it <2>
{} corey delon is a steelyeyed hood who is being released from prison tomorrow when he breaks into the cell of another prisoner vogel volont to tell him that he can arrange to help him escape tomorrow if he agrees to join him in a heist he has planned <0>
vogel escapes from a moving train as a massive police hunt is on the way for his capture led by the fairhaired corsican superintendent mattei bourvil who is quite an interesting character as well as being a catlover whose boss the police commissioner while pressing him to do everything possible to get vogel lectures him that every man is guilty something that slowly sinks into matteis consciousness as his investigation broadens <0>
{} while the escape is taking place corey goes back to marseilles to get money from his crime boss rico ekyan who tries to put him off so corey robs him causing rico to send a couple of his gang members after him who end up getting shot by vogel who by this time has joined corey in the car he just bought with ricos money <0>
the intense action scenes amidst the changing weather from rain to snow plus the wooded area and the roadblocks the men must cross to get back to paris gives the film an air of resolute desperation that is intriguing to watch as each camera shot is done by the hands of a master reaching far into his characters and their surroundings <2>
to help with the jewel heist vogel suggests a friend of his a former police marksman who cracked up from the pressure of the job jansen yves who is first seen having a nightmare that bugs are attacking him that is very movingly shot and is framed like it is a painting on canvas by one of the masters of horror painting someone like a francis bacon <2>
bunuel has very effectively used surreal shots like this in some of his films <1>
{} the heist of the place vendome is excuted in silence for the odd minutes it takes to pull off the job <0>
there are five men involved in this jewel heist these three plus a tipoff man and the fence <0>
but when the robbery is completed the fence backs out because he is pressured to by a local gangster santi pier who is a nightclub owner and pimp and a one time informant for mattei who leans heavily on him to cooperate in this case <0>
for mattei there is no such thing as police without informers <0>
this relationship made in hell makes no one an innocent <0>
{} the films conclusion is as violent as it has to be since the mood was set from the films onset to end this way <0>
by this time we know all the characters rather well as we see who turns on the other and how hypertense a policemans job is with not that much sanity separating his job from the criminals <0>
{} this is a top notch noir film <2>
it has done an outstanding job in uncovering the themes of alienation and desperation that drive men so hard that it is impossible for them to transcend their criminal nature <2>

[17963/b]
{} how do you like to see christ depicted in films <0>
the wachowski brothers refugees from marvel comic books with one critically acclaimed lesbian noir type of film under their belt bound have chosen a guy who works for a legitimate software company by day thomas anderson reeves but at night works feverishly alone in his room as a hacker known as neo who has broken every law in the book against computer misuse <0>
the wachowski brothers must think they hit upon something really important to convey because in my book any film that goes way over two hours in length thinks of itself as important <-1>
and by earmarking the young literate computer age audience to buy into their intellectual scifier as they flatter them by telling them that it is only at a young age that one can develop the ability to have a chance of understanding the message delivered here they have done just that making me wonder how they expect adults to react to their film <-1>
{} and the good news the film brings is that the one is alive as prophesized in the bible <1>
here he is just disguised as a regular person and he is a hacker <0>
he will soon learn of an evil force out there called the matrix that not everyone is aware of that is an allencompassing virtualreality program overseen by omnipotent computers <0>
as the filmmakers get involved in their little pseudophilosophy game of whats real and what isnt promising those with an open mind a chance to be unplugged to find out what is real <0>
i think they really believe they will get unplugged mainly because they had the good sense to pay money to see the movie <1>
{} what the wachowski brothers are good at is style and visuals and what we see on screen is ground breaking fun to watch in the form of exhilarating camera work from the opening sequence onwards as a mixture of kungfu and scifi schmaltz is used which is as entertaining <2>
as it is ominously intellectually pretentious <-1>
as a computer hacker named trinity moss she is a take off on mary magdalene which is why there is no sex between her and neo just intent eye contact as she uses her kungfu and supernatural skills just like its done in the comics to escape from a police trap that comes by way of info an informer gave them <0>
arriving on the scene just a bit late are the ultra serious and menacing agents created from artificial intelligence skilled in kungfu clad in uniforms of dark suits and sunglasses led by agent smith hugo who is well aware of the group that trinity belongs to and is optimistic that he will get that renegade group and their leader morpheus fishburne who is depicted as a john the baptist type <0>
the police informer has also tipped them off about a hacker named neo who is about to be recruited into morpheuss group so the action now swings into the polices capture of neo and we see how they bug him and i mean literally bug him and when he escapes from the police it is just as thrilling to see how morpheuss crew debugs him <0>
{} the action scenes are the virtue in this movie <1>
when we get to see morpheus on board his timetraveling hovercraft uss nebuchadnezzar with his small crew of believers he being depicted as the true believer who blindly believes in what he is doing is best for the world we are in pedantic trouble at this jucture of the film as we all must be lectured to <-1>
all that talk all those explanations every bit of pseodo philosophical occultism is pulled out of the hat to make the story plausible <1>
except the more rationally it is explained by the groups leader morpheus the more holes in his story are opened up and the judas in his group who only wants to return to the matrix in his old job at the factory is tired of all this hype after nine years of eating the same slop is played by cypher joe now eating a juicy steak with the agents and declaring ignorance is bliss seems to make as much sense as the mumbojumbo morpheus is talking about <-1>
as morpheus explains all this to neo who believe me if you just take one look at him no one in his right mind would mistake him for even one second as the one but morpheus is convinced he is the one <0>
as he fills his head with programs a young and upandcoming christ needs no more pacifism here but plenty of kungfu warrior stuff as he prepares to take him to the oracle for a private consultation <0>
evidently she has insights into things even the true believers and the next christ dont even know <0>
at last a voice in appreciation for the muses arises <0>
{} this is a high tech movie whose action scenes are for the most part humorless notwithstanding the facile ideas it throws in as this films playful gestures come about as the chase takes place between the bad guys who cant die as depicted on screen with splendid computer imagery as we see those who represent the unnamed governments in this unnamed city as lawful agents try to round up this group of hackers who also cant die <1>
until all those action scenes get surplanted by the very human and humorous scene of neo and the oracle played with grace and dignity by gloria foster as he asks her if he is christ as she tells him if you are in love you dont need anyone to tell you that <2>
{} so now we have a hero who has doubts he has already learned from morpheus that the world he is living in is false but he cant return to normalcy because he chose the red pill instead of the blue pill that morpheus so dramatically gave him when he told him that there is no going back once you choose the kind of world you want to live in <0>
and now he is stuck searching for the truth <0>
i dont think he even has time to go out and see an escapist scifi film just for kicks <0>
it is serious business saving the world with not many people even willing to thank you for your effort <0>
but he at least found morpheus the one he was searching for but as an interesting twist in the story it was morpheus who was looking for him <0>
so the two have found each other and now the rest of the story has to be played out as it is written or does man have free will to make his own destiny <0>
{} you will only get questions in this film not answers <0>
but one of the questions is from what source do the questions come from and that is answered in an interview with the directors i read in the film zine american cinematographer as the wachowski brothers freely talked about what kind of film they were trying to make and who influenced them <0>
{} the film ends with neo looking like clark kent as he is stepping out of a telephone booth to give the film the full comic book flavor it deserves as if superman is there already in place ready to stop the bad guys <-1>
for the films point of reference to anything resembling theology and theory it was jean baudrillards simulacra and simulation that was used as reference material referring to his take on ecclessiastics <0>
that was the book neo had in his room when his computer friends came by to pick up their pirated program <0>
he is the modern french philospher with his theories of time as unreal and his critique of hyperreality and how the truth cant be reached but violence can that influenced the wachowski brothers in the making of this film <0>
{} but even more than a biblical film though if you are looking for this to be a spiritual film there are plenty of symbols in the film to allude to this being so or another look at the world of lewis carrolls alice in wonderland this is a computerage film that questions if we have just become batteries for our computers who have evolved past us in their knowledge of the world <0>
and the questions of who we are abound as neo is now free of the illusions he has lived with as he wonders how he will handle this new found experience <0>
and the only intellectual question we may be left to ask ourselves if we take the new myth presented here seriously is who needs christ when we got superman or do we need neither or both or do we just need christ <0>

{} fleg george sanders is a gentleman rare book collector willing to do anything in his pursuit of collecting rare books which includes forgery and murder <0>
his partner is the attractive myra blandy gail patrick an equally treacherous conspirator who is capable of doing almost anything to make money dishonestly <0>
this offbeat suspense story with some romance thrown in is a fastmoving crime caper taking place mostly in a library <0>
{} fleg while visiting the library to look at the rare richard burbage edition of shakespeares hamlet kept under glass kills the library guard and steals the valuable folio <0>
instead of selling it outright he forges copies of it and has his associate myra set up the book deals to sell the forgeries as originals <0>
against his wishes she sells the forgery to martin cleever sidney blackmer <0>
fleg warns her to give him back his money that he works for the nazi gestapo collecting rare works of art and he will kill them if he feels he has been cheated <0>
{} but myra sees a way out of her dilemma when a private detective from new york hal mcbyrne denning who is working for a client she indirectly cheated in the states tells her he is onto her little swindle <0>
she seems to be caught with two bad choices get killed by cleevers men or go to jail through mcbyrne <0>
but leave it to myra she flirts with the womanizing detective and strikes a deal with him whereas he will shield her from being involved in the scam <0>
she thereby uses him romantically only as a way out her dilemma and at the same time strikes a deal with cleever pretending to help him find fleg <0>
she tells him that mcbyrne is really fleg and sets it up so that they will meet in the library <0>
{} the carefully woven plot takes place right before closing time in the library as myra tries to kill two birds with one stone by getting cleever to try and kill mcbyrne when she gets him to go to the library to get a book for her <0>
the story gets further complicated when fleg also comes to the library posing as a phony policeman accompanied by his entire gang posing as cops <0>
he keeps everyone locked in the library as he puts himself in charge of the murder investigation <0>
{} the library scene results in a few murders taking place with nazis and crooks running after each other some more rare books being stolen romantic entanglements becoming complicated between mcbyrnes and flegs romance with the duplicitous myra and with mcbyrne also meeting an innocent and attractive librarian whom he falls for kay ryan lynne roberts and to add further confusion and air raid takes place as the library goes dark in the middle of the bogus murder investigation <0>
{} its a spirited film with enough cheap freudian explanations about the forger and his associate to keep you in stitches with its freudianisms <0>
sanderss typical suave and maniacal performance plus the bw noirlike lighting for the film give it a mysterious look and the many twists in the plot and its unusual location make it a better than usual bmovie <2>

{} the three biggest superstars in this genre films cast are not seen on screen together until only price and lee are briefly seen in the very last segment of the film dr browning vincent price insane scientist christopher lee fremont the head of british intelligence and peter cushing maj benedict heinrich head of a fascist government are in a horror film that shows little affinity for the genre and apart from a few scares this is a rather tepid effort put forth by the director <0>
{} scream and scream again was based on peter saxons novel the disoriented man but it is the story that seems out of whack rather than the title <0>
{} the film opens inspiringly enough as a robust jogger is seen on the road gracefully running and then suddenly is having a heart attack but then the scene intercuts to his waking up and screaming in a hospital bed and finding his limbs have been removed <0>
each time the film cuts back to him a robotictype of a nurse treats him insensitive to his screams as he discovers he keeps losing another limb which sets the stage for the films very chilling beginning <0>
{} but what remains constant during this moody piece is confusion as a crusty veteran police inspector in charge of a grizzly murder investigation bellaver alfred marks discovers that he is dealing with a psychopathic rapistkiller <-1>
going over the lab results of the strangled and mutilated girl who was found in the woods with his new pathologist david sorel christopher matthews he discovers two vampire puncture marks on her wrist <0>
when another girl is found killed in the same vampire style and her jugular vein is burst open but similarly no blood is found on the scene the police realize that there is something strange here as they decide to go after the serial killer by having one of their policewoman wired with a mike and used as a lure for the killer at the same disco the other two girls were picked up in <0>
incidently the loud music coming out of the disco is played by a group called the amen corner <0>
{} in the films most animated sequence the mad killer keith michael gothard is trapped by the police after showing inhuman strength and overpowering four policeman to escape to the top of a rock quarry <0>
when captured he is securely handcuffed to a car but escapes by pulling his hand off and running toward the house of the mysterious dr browning where he flings himself into a vat of acid <0>
an offbeat reaction to this scene is that bellaver orders one of the pursuing cops to stick his hand in the vat thinking it was only water to retrieve the killers body instead he ends up losing his arm <0>
these are the quirky characteristics found throughout the film that makes its humor rather odd and might appeal to certain fans of this genre <0>
{} bellavar has been ordered to stay away from the respected dr browning who is respected enough to even have a government research contract <0>
the case is now officially closed <0>
but sorel is not satisfied believing that dr browning has something to do with these murders <0>
he gets the help of another policewoman and goes out to brownings house to investigate <0>
unfortunately she gets caught and is taken to brownings lab hospital to be prepped for an operation while he gets caught by the good doctor inside the lab and is forced to listen to an explanation about what all the murders were about and about the master race browning is creating <0>
keith the vampire killer was a composite who is not human but made up of body parts from others and has no feelings for pain <0>
the result is a race of emotionless and mindless androids <0>
there are many others that the scientist has created in his lab but they are more closely akin to being robots as he apologetically explains my group is only in its infant state <0>
a fascist type of government located somewhere in europe with plans for world dominance is behind this research movement <0>
{} while this was going on another composite of the master race a fascist in some unnamed european country konratz marshall jones who kills anyone who gets in his way including his superiors in his own government he kills the peter cushing character off <0>
he has made a deal with the british government that he will return a downed pilot of a spy plane for all the evidence collected by the police in the vampire murder case <0>
when bellaver refuses to let the nazi take the evidence with him even if this has been approved by government higherups the star detective of the film is killed as konratz puts two fingers on his shoulders and bam bellaver crumples to the floor with blood oozing out of his mouth <0>
{} when sorel is about to be ripped apart by the insane dr browning konratz enters the lab and since he is opposed to browning who happens to also be a composite the two androids of the master race fight with browning putting konratz into the acid bath <0>
then fremont head of the british secret service also a composite of the master race decides brownings usefulness has come to an end and tosses the bad doctor into the conveniently placed acid vat <0>
the film ends with a cryptic warning by fremont that all is not over with yet <0>
{} this muddled story is not supposed to make sense and it doesnt it is supposed to shock your senses and if you were thusly shocked i suppose you got your moneys worth out of this b film <1>
there is no real character study accomplished <-1>
the story remains a shallow one never presenting further ploys for its plot about world rule or the activities of a secret police force or nazi type of scientific experiments <-1>
the dialogue ranged from being trite to being ludicrous <-2>
overall this was a weakly crafted film that probably has brought to the surface enough undeveloped ideas in it to make it a somewhat bearable film to view during parts of it and a film that fans of the three horror stars should want to see if for no other reason but for that alone <-1>

{} douglas fairbanks plays his first action hero role as zorro the sort of part he will play for the rest of his film career before this very popular film he was cast only in light comedies <0>
he also produced the film as he formed a studio called united artists that also included partners mary pickford d w griffith and charlie chaplin <0>
{} this funtype of swashbuckler gave him a chance to showoff his athletic ability as he himself did all the dueling scenes and acrobatic routines the story required <0>
he is dressed in a black maskand cape which gave the role a certain amount of appeal to audiences <0>
{} the film is not much on character study instead its filled with action sequences and a melodramatic love story between zorro who hides his true identity of being the son of the aristocratic rancher don alejandro de gray and the sweet lolita pukido marguerite <0>
{} he is forced by his father to seek a wife lolita and appears to be very unmanly to her forcing her to reject him even though he is so wealthy and her father wants this marriage <0>
she is the daughter of a blueblooded spanish family that has fallen on hard times her father is don carlos pulido charles hill mailes and her mother is dona catalina pulido claire mcdowell <0>
{} the reason for the zorro disguise is because he just returned three months ago from studying in spain and wants to secretly organize the caballeros against the oppressors who are especially cruel towards the poor the natives and the priests <0>
he leaves his trademark of a z on the skin of those oppressors he duels with <0>
{} the action takes place in th century southern california where the corrupt governor alvarado periolat who is from the northern part where he controls the colonial territory comes south because he is upset with zorros interference in his affairs <0>
he will post a reward to get him dead or alive <0>
there is no mistake about who the goodguys and who the badguys are in this childlike adventure story <0>
the heavies are played like heavies were played in the old days of filmmaking and are the governor and his henchmen sergeant pedro gonzalez noah berry and captain ramos robert mckim <0>
{} a typical action scene is the one in the cantina where zorro suddenly appears and fights a duel with sergeant ramos while keeping all the other soldiers at bay <0>
it reminded me of a charlie chaplin routine the one where hes the tramp and is kicking the cop in his behind <0>
zorro likes to laugh a lot and play catandmouse games with his enemies allthewhile courting danger as he disarms his opponent and toys with him <0>
{} the film disappointed me in many ways not the least being that his plan to help the poor seemed misplaced and that this was more a story of aristocrats and those of wealth versus bad politicians rather than the robin hood story it projected itself to be <-1>
it was really a stretch to believe that the noble zorro was anything but a rich aristocrat having a bit of sport and finding love with someone he could have easily found love with anyway without going through his masquerade <0>
the story itself was a cliche featuring his cardboardtyped father wanting his son not to be an idler and make something of himself while the son feigns being fatigued all the time and acting effeminate performing silly magic tricks when he should be seriously courting the eligible senorita his father fixed him up with <-1>
there is also the faithful native servant roberto tote du crow who knows don diego vegas secrets but cannot speak he can only hear <0>
it was the type of part you can almost expect to see in a film like this and one that is void of any real human emotions <0>
{} there are no surprises in this predictable costume actioner but it is pleasantly shot in bw with a tinted look to it <1>
it should please those who like their films to be lighthearted <1>
because it was such a successful film boxoffice wise and was a precursor to the type of film hollywood is noted for putting forth it could be interesting just to see how this silent yarn compares with the viewers take on the more modern action films <1>

{} a dirtier version of dirty harry to be sure if that is possible to believe as azuma takeshi kitano is the lone detective who takes the law into his own hands against a yakuza organization and a corrupt police force pushing drugs while protecting his wayward sister akari maiko from her tendency to go out with the wrong boy a gang rape and her drug addiction <0>
{} this directorial debut for kitano hanabisonatine is a visual stunner in unmitigated violence <0>
the violent cop is as violent and gratuitously violent of an entertaining film as i have ever seen <0>
the audience gets a chance to watch kitano smash punks around who would probably get away with their crimes or never receive their proper punishment and the viewer sees an angry cop who is psychotic in his approach to his job unrelenting in using his fists not his head in getting things squared away with the criminal element <0>
he is also a glutton for punishment as well as in dishing it out <0>
{} in the opening scene a group of teenagers beat upon a homeless man and pummel him unconscious as azuma comes to the affluent house of one of the punky boys who did this crime and has his mother stay away as he goes up to the kids room and beats him silly while he tells him by tomorrow he had better confess in the police station to what he did <0>
{} this being the first day on the job for the new pompous police chief shiro who calls azuma in to berate him for how he got the kid to come down to the police station and confess to the crime <0>
but even as the chief lectures him that he is too wild he has to admit that he is effective in getting the job done <0>
{} the eager rookie police officer kikuchi makoto is assigned to work with azuma and tells him that he wants to learn how to be a policeman from him <0>
azuma takes the uptight rookie drinking gambling and freely borrows money from him <0>
their first case together is investigating the stabbing death of a lowly drug pusher <0>
this crime will begin to pit the detective against a drug ring supplying local pushers with the drugs as they are supported by corrupt police one of them being azumas good friend on the vice squad iwaki hiraizumi <0>
{} there will be many twists to the tale as azuma in the conventional part of the story tracks down all those on the take and who are part of the operation <0>
finally he narrows down the gangs enforcer responsible for a string of murders as someone called kiyohiro hakuryu and they have a few actionpacked faceoffs that are bloody and question the officers ethics as he plants drugs on the gay assassin and tries to kill him while questioning him in the locker room of the police station <0>
{} the head of the yakuza organization is a ruthless drug kingpin called nito kishibe who had hired the sadistic kiyohiro ordering him to do two murders for him a low level drug pusher named emoto and the corrupt cop iwaki not the extra third one kiyohiro mistakenly threw in <0>
taking advantage of the weakness in the yakuza operation azuma takes them on singlehandedly as his corrupt superior officers suspend him from the force <0>
{} kitano is overpowering in his mood swings of overbearing silence to emotional tenderness for his unstable sister and then to exhibiting explosive violence against the drug dealers <0>
its an action flick that questions ones sensibilities and has enough original twists in the story to keep you guessing how many of the cops are corrupt and what method will be used to kill off the yakuza members <2>
there was something very likable about kitanos monster cop that might be hard to rationalize but it does draw him close to the audience in a surprising way <1>
if you like your violence with a dose of some intelligent dramatics thrown in for good measure you should find this flawlessly wellpaced film satisfying to some degree <2>
but you better have a strong stomach for violence and how ridiculous this story is built around titillating the audience with an abnormal display of graphic violence <0>

{} no end takes place in poland during the early s it is at a time martial law was in place and when any kind of minor resistance against the government political graffiti or striking was met with a few years of jail time <0>
kieslowski blue red white decalogue deals with this from the humanistic point of view of a young politically aware lawyer zyro jerzy who dies from a heart attack and returns as a ghost to watch all the sorrowful events that take place after his death <0>
the film focuses on three people whom he was concerned about ula grazyma plays his widow who cant get over loving him <0>
what startles her is how she didnt know how happy she was with him when he was alive <0>
his client the political activist darek artur who is now on trial for being a union striker <0>
darek ideologically refuses to compromise his position even for a lenient sentence <0>
and the lawyer who takes zyros place in defending darek his old mentor a much more wary and pragmatical lawyer labrador bandini <0>
labrador takes the case only after he learns that he is being forced to retire because he has reached the mandatory age of and decides he wants to make this controversial case his swan song <0>
{} this film is bubbling over with passion for the solidarity movement as well as for the sensuousness and passion the widow feels for her departed husband so much so that she sees her husband in another mans strong hands and makes ecstatic love with him in a one time stand <0>
{} the political argument of the times is best seen through the eyes of the idealistic uncompromising darek who has a wife and child to support but still thinks he is selling out if he is setfree something his lawyer can get for him if he accepts the gift horse of freedom <0>
while his lawyer works hard for his case proud of his clients integrity but is convinced that there is no real choice the only choice is the more rational position that he is better off not going to jail <0>
the realpolitik of this dilemma is powerfully presented as is the emotional state of ula internally wrestling with her memories and conscience trying desperately to find a way out of her emotional entrapment <0>
{} the film was powerful enough in its political jibes to have made the state and the church and the opposition party condemn it <0>
though this is not the directors topofthe line artistic work it does fit positively into his opus <1>
his only failing moments seemed to be in trying to get the ghost involved with what was going on in the lives of those around him <0>
it seemed awkward and out of place in this straight forward film whose darkened cameras captured enough of the sobering mood of poland for the story to be a compelling one a story about the unfinished business of the struggle for freedom <-1>
the title seems to signify for the director an unending search for political justice something he was not optimistic in achieving in such a repressive country <1>

{} a most improbable but engaging romantic mystery that holds our attention and teases our sensibilities <1>
the first word out of jays novo mouth is sht as he stands on the boardwalk at san sebastian ready to commit suicide after being jilted by his girlfriend and unable to work for the last years as a rock singer with his group called flies <0>
suddenly a motorcycle crashes over the boardwalk railing onto the nights deserted beach and jay foregoes his immediate suicide plans to rush to the aid of the helmeted victim <0>
to his surprise he discovers that its a beautiful girl and upon questioning her discovers she is suffering from amnesia and has no id on her <0>
as an impulse when the ambulance arrives he tells the driver that her name is lisa and that he is her boyfriend and proceeds to give her a big kiss <0>
at the hospital he supplies the night receptionist salvador fuentes lera information that he makes up about her giving her the surname fuentes that he takes from his nametag <0>
later on he will discover that the receptionist is her brother <0>
{} lisa sticks to her amnesia story and jay sticks to his pursuit of her feeling rejuvenated by her presence in his life <0>
when he is about to be questioned in detail about her by the hospital staff he sneaks her out of the hospital and they take off together heading for a camping resort called the red squirrel <0>
{} at the resort they meet a meddlesome family who help them pitch a tent and invite them over for dinner <0>
there are signs that what is happening to the two lovers is getting to be heavy and what seems to be is not exactly what is <0>
but what is definetly happening is that they are making passionate love and he is constantly inventing things he says she did before she lost her memory <0>
but she doesnt passively accept from him what he tells her <0>
{} when a radio message comes over the air saying that a man named felix carmelo is looking for his mentally deranged wife who ran away the description of her appearance is exactly like that of lisa even though the name given for her is sofia fuentes <0>
well the game is up for the two lost souls as the people in the campsite are not fooled and felix is tipped off where to find her and when he arrives at the resort to reclaim her a battle begins with her new boyfriend <0>
{} the storyline is awkward melodramatic and incredulous and the ending is somewhat ludicrous and overplayed but what becomes interesting is the psychological games played by the couple <1>
they explore their identities and sexual cravings trying to find out who they are and what love means to them all in the face of their insecurities and death wishes and lies <0>
the basque directorwriter has created a story with enough twists in it to keep you guessing at what will happen next but the film left me with a bittersweet reaction to the romance <1>

{} this powerhouse of a film is geared to get under your skin and is not as most hollywood films are made to amuse you and cater to your idea of what a romantic film is supposed to be <1>
labutes debut film is hard to describe though the plot is simple enough but this is not a film that depends on plot for it to be understood <1>
{} labute looks at men through the eyes of successful thirtyish corporate types and penetrates their real feelings about women themselves and their relationships <0>
he gets us to listen in on what they are trying to communicate to each other <0>
this is accomplished in the sterile power driven workplace of high tech where the men who work there make their own rules about what works and roam the sleek corridors of their modern glass offices and hold manly conversations in the immaculately clean bathrooms they feel very comfortable in a substitute for the proverbial locker room <0>
that what comes out of these conversations to say the least is disdainful but that is not the point labute is trying to make nor does he use these talks solely for shock value <0>
what is taking place is more real than that and much more frightening <0>
we are made witness to what it takes to be in their company and we want to puke <0>
we want to say these are freaks or they are not the people we come into daily contact with or that this is exaggerated but what is true in a certain sense is that these are the regular guys we ordinarily come into contact with the guys cranking out this booming economy buying condos living luxuriously lifestyles not worried about the worlds problems and the unfortunate they are the smart movers and shakers of the business world the ones who are countrys future and present leaders <0>
{} playwright labute uses words that are meant to be spiteful and piercing to ones fragile ego <1>
the tough business guys understand this and can talk the talk and fight for their place on the corporate ladder with seemingly effortless grace as they constantly watch their backs <0>
{} the scene with the black intern is bound to rub people the wrong way as it takes us into the strident relationships these business warriors have and adds the racial issue as another dimension to its political incorrectness stance <-1>
the black intern learns how it is to feel that he is not being humiliated when he is being humiliated by his boss aaron and at the end of the lecture he receives he is reduced to a flunky getting coffee for the boss that is after he is told to take down his pants so that aaron can see if he has balls as supposedly a secret deal is struck between him and aaron that will benefit both <0>
we can now be reassured that the old boy network will be passed on even between the races as the intern is initiated into the business world community <0>
{} aaron along with his college friend matt who is chosen to be the temporary supervisor of the project they are assigned to by their company are on a sixweek business assignment to this city that labute chooses not to name <0>
{} we are struck by the different personalities of the two matt is insecure and geeky <0>
aaron is handsome and bold <0>
but what they have in common is what at first seems most important to them they have struck out and have been rejected by women and feel a bitterness to them <0>
aaron is very vocal about this and suggests to matt that they do something about this that might appear strange to him at first but when he thinks about it he will realize that it will give him a way to restore some of his selfesteem by getting even with all females this is of course absurd <0>
but the point of the story is that their life is absurd so why not get what you want no matter what you have to do to get it <0>
at least we have the feeling that aaron understands this <0>
{} aaron suggests they meet a woman who is a loser and they both date her without her knowing that they are doing this and they will treat her as nicely as they can and before they go back to their regular workplace they will both dump her <0>
matt is at first put off by this but soon agrees when aaron comes up with the victim a deaf typist stacy who is not bad looking but because of her disability which causes her to talk in garbled tones has lost her sense of selfesteem <0>
she is the perfect victim for their villany <0>
{} the movie is not driven by plot so what unfolds is somewhat unconventional for movie lore though not for the world of plays from where the director draws his strength ala mamet which has a much richer history of misogynistic characters being the ones you love to hate <0>
what is here unpleasant and shameful and immoral is played out to the hilt with all the traumas one could expect <2>
i must respectfully say this film has balls <2>
no matter how politically incorrect and unbelievable the story might be it still attracts our attention and makes us react to it on a visceral level <2>
i think that is because we have all questioned our relationships at one time or another and felt a certain vulnerability and wonder about how that other person now feels the one who did harm to us how is he or she getting on <0>
this film does that to us it provokes us to look at things that are unpleasant in our lives <1>
{} we realize that aaron wins because he is a charmer but those not taken in by sharing his deceits would not be taken in by his charm <0>
he is ruthless because he understands the nature of the business he is in and is willing to do what it takes to succeed <0>
but we are not really comfortable with aarons aggressiveness and out first reaction is to recoil from him in horror when seeing him so depicted on screen <0>
but i wonder how many aarontypes we have met in reallife and didnt recoil from <0>
as for matt he is only too humanly frail and his insecurities become in many ways too easy for us to identify with for us to care about him <0>
at first we might tend to be feeling a bit sorry for matt but since his weakness do not prevent him from being sneakily cruel to others we soon realize that he might even be worst than aaron who at least is following his natural instincts <0>
and his lies are the kind that those without a true sense of themselves tell while the matts of this world are the humorless types you might have had a morning coffee with and felt you were with someone you didnt quite like but didnt know why as they seemed nice enough in the office ambiance but you know instinctively that you cant trust them that they will harm you if they can that they just cant help being the worms they are <0>
{} stacy is the only one in the film that we are supposed to feel for <0>
she is the passive female who is capable of giving us her blind love <0>
she is the trophy many an aggressive businessman has won for himself that is if they can somehow cover up her handicap i see her as a symbol for the dumb blond type the boss marries or has an affair with except in this case she is the deaf nice smart girl <0>
{} the three stars are all excellent in convincing us of who they are in the film <2>
stacys role might seem to be the most difficult one to pull off because of her portrayal of deafness and vulnerability and being the female in the film <0>
she becomes a representative for all women <0>
but she is resilient and we are left with the impression that in the long run of things she will come through this embarrassing episode in her life better than the two men she is the only one that is capable of knowing what love is and that is because she is the only one who could get a glimmer of what the truth is even after being deceived <0>
one can surmise that aaron is heading down a long road of manipulations and false senses of security and that matt is falling apart because he cant make up his mind about who he is or what he wants to be and what he has to do to find himself <0>
{} this is not a flawless picture but it is one that penetrates the masculine soul of the competitive capitalistic system that feeds on aggressiveness and getting results at the cost of coming to grips with ones more tender feminine side <2>
it is able to captivate us because its words have power <2>

[17280/c]
{} this bw film is based on the reallife criminal known affectionately by his cohorts as the general martin cahill brendan gleeson <0>
it begins by him getting executed in front of his swanky house by a lone ira member <0>
the film immediately flashes back to his squalid birthplace showing him as a kid played by the butcher boys eamonn owens as he was growing up to be a criminal sent to reform school and almost molested and then beaten by a priest <0>
it seems it was in his blood to be bad <0>
he grows up to despise anyone who isnt from his old neighborhood or part of his gang <0>
priests are assigned the role of being pederasts which leaves cahill with a bitter opinion of religion and any authority figure for the rest of his life <0>
the ira and the protestant loyalists are lumped together with all politicians as assholes <0>
the police are simply pigs <0>
voight plays the neighborhood cop who tried to befriend the youngster but was spurned by him <0>
he is pictured as a straight but not too swift cop early on in voights career he is doing his sworn duty to kick the poor out of their homes and as his career is shown moving parallel to cahills we see how he rises up the bureacratic ladder of the police to become an inspector until he is thought of by cahill to be just as dirty as he is a sort of alterego <0>
{} cahill finds romance with frances kennedy and tina ball who happen to be sisters as he lives happily with both of them raising kids and supporting them with the loot he steals on his capers <0>
he is a devilish little fatty certainly not looking the part of a big time hood as he loves to wear selfdeprecating t shirts with pigs and slogans on them he also makes a habit of trying to hide his face wherever he goes in public or when the police interrogate him <0>
i guess these character quirks are supposed to make him somewhat appealing or show that he has some kind of psychological failings <0>
{} when we talk about cahill we are not talking about a robin hood even if thats what he fancies himself as as he steals from the rich only but that is only to line his own pockets and once in a while he helps out those from his old neighborhood <0>
he does that mostly to gain favor with his people so that they dont rat him out <0>
he is also shown as being brutal threatening court witnesses and finding loopholes in the law to get him off anyway he can no matter who he hurts <0>
the film to its credit did not make him out to be a good guy <0>
but the story is skewed in his favor making everyone else who opposes him look like suckers <0>
{} i think if you look objectively at this rogue he is rotten to the core or as voight more appropriately says hes a scumbag <0>
he shows no feelings when he learns that honest working stiffs are layed off their job when the jewelers he robs goes out of business because of the robbery <0>
he shows no feelings robbing houses and living off what he steals <0>
i wonder how many critics who raved about this film because of cahills winsome mannerisms would still like this character if he robbed them <0>
and that is the point of this slickly done methodical film that makes it impossible for me to fall for the story i just dont care what happens to him <-1>
his life story bored me <-1>
i thought of him robbing houses in a miners helmet being a smooth cat burglar as merely clever filmmaking capturing what is sort of odd to watch as this fat guy bounces around and is so agile <0>
it was great casting making gleeson the lead <1>
but i still find nothing in his story that appeals to me about him <-1>
i was not impressed with his remorse after he nailed one of his gang members hands to a pool table after he thought that he was stealing from him <-1>
cahill is just a scumbag and voight was right <0>
in fact the film could have been more interesting if it was about voight <-1>
i found him to be the more fascinating character in the story <-1>
sometimes just being ordinary hides so much more about a person and voight seemed to have heavy things on his mind that might have been more interesting than following this deadend obvious tale <-1>
{} the robberies he pulls off we have seen done countless times before on film <0>
so all the precision planning that goes into robbing the museum of all its valuable paintings and the chase scenes via car or scooter were all well done but so what <-1>
this films theme has been done too many times for me to be carried away by such direction <-1>
i wanted something else from this film but i didnt get it <-1>
what i got was a masterful performance that i cant deny from gleeson and a director who can be magnificent in setting a playful confrontational tone with what he had to work with and letting the camera do its job <1>
if i wasnt revolted by cahill as a criminal i would be inclined to rate this film much higher <-1>

[19979/a+]
{} john fords epic western about america and its racial past is the quintessential american film about what it once meant to be american more than any other film that i could think of and that includes citizen kane <2>
it is fords best one that is much more than the western it appears to be it is a film that is eventually about selfdiscovery seen symbolically through the eyes of one man john wayne <1>
the searchers tells of the perilous and obsessive year quest to find yearold debbie the niece of ethan edwards john wayne who was abducted by a raiding comanche party under chief scar brandon <0>
{} the embittered ethan arrives home to texas in after serving the confederacy and riding on his own for the last years probably robbing banks as he shows up with bags of newly minted coin which he does not explain how he got riding to the isolated ranch of his brother aaron coy and his wife martha jordan and their children ben lyden lucy pippa and debbie lana and the partcherokee oneeighth son they adopted martin pawley jeffrey hunter whose parents were slaughtered by comanches and was found by ethan <0>
{} ethan treats martin with utter disdain saying he could take him for a halfbreed and refuses to have him call him uncle <0>
soon after ethans return a raiding party under chief scar kills aaron martha and ben while a posse wayne and martin among them was out looking for what they thought were rustlers <0>
the indians abduct the two girls keeping debbie but killing her older sister <0>
{} wayne searches for her with martin and brad harry the boyfriend of lucy but when lucy is found dead by ethan brad in a craze rushes off to charge the indians and is killed <0>
ethan pushes on relentlessly following their trail aiming to kill debbie and her captor chief scar for violating her declaring that once a white girl is captured by comanches she is no longer white <0>
martin goes along so that he can prevent ethan from doing something vengeful <0>
{} it is a psychologically dark story of a man who is heroic but filled with a bitterness that he cant get out of his system <0>
there is not one single actor in the world who could have played this part better than wayne <2>
his odyssey as he strikes the pose of a loner a selfassured rugged individualist filled with racial hatred and love for his kin takes place in the beautifully photographed vistas of monument valley where cinematographer winton hoch caught the mythic landscapes of the west with its red earth and mesas and all its splendor and ominous passages and isolation <1>
{} ford threw the whole panoply of western gear into the search from the slapstick antics of mose harper worden playing the shakesperian fool leading wayne to the trail of debbie twice only asking in return to be taken home to sit by a fireplace in a rockin chair to the garrulous texas ranger captain reverend clayton ward bond who comically switches roles from gunfighter to man of peace without batting an eyelash <0>
{} the two main questions john wayne faces are what to do with debbie <0>
and from the words in the stan jones ballad sung in the opening credits that asks what makes a man wander and turn his back on home the second question becomes will wayne ever come home <0>
in the opening scene he is only there briefly and does not feel very comfortable in that short stay even when idolized by the children <0>
in the last scene when he finds redemption not killing debbie after he rescues her and raises her up in his arms reminded in that splitsecond of how he held her as a child thereby changing his mind and bringing the yearold home to his closest neighbors the jorgensens to stay for good <0>
but he never crosses the doorway to his home his home is in the past just as chief scars is <0>
it is a past that goes no further than the wars fought and the hatred ingrained in them <0>
he will not go to california and will not advance civilization he represents the past that must be put asunder before others can move on and turn the desert into farm land and ranches <0>
{} for martin the quest will end in domesticity as he will marry laurie vera miles the daughter of the jorgensens <0>
wayne will be like the dead comanche he shot the two eyes out of so he can travel the spirit land forever never finding a proper resting place <0>
{} ethan does not belong to either the white settlers or the indians <0>
that he hates indians so much yet speaks their language and feels comfortable with their ways more so than he does with white society makes it difficult to figure why he has so much hatred for them <0>
{} his disdain for society and home life is evident in the brooding figure he presented himself as when he first came home <0>
aaron is not as pleased to see him as is his wife who it is implied loves ethan and might have been involved with him romantically before marrying aaron <0>
ethans generosity to the children is shown by the gifts he gives them a saber for ben and his war medal to debbie so that she can have something to wear around her neck just like the gold pendant he gave to lucy when she was younger <0>
{} the john wayne character is a complex one having many paradoxes such as all his loves and hates for people <0>
his story is visceral poetry a tragedy that turns ridiculous as ford wanted it to be and it has unexpected psychological twists to it that can be read into the story by ones own relationship with america <0>
it is hard not to substitute his hatred for indians into a hatred for blacks and it is easy to see how waynes soul could be construed as americas soul <0>
{} make no mistake about it this is not an ordinary or very good western this is undoubtedly a masterpiece of american cinema one that many of the early s film critics couldnt see <2>
it is not that it is a particularly profound movie but it is one that caught the emotions and the metaphors of a rich country with a paradoxical past and an intangible future <1>
overtheyears the status of this film has grown immeasurably to the point that its antihero hero is now a fixture on the cinematic scene along with the recognition that ford has created a work that searches deeply into a mans interior and into the countrys consciousness <1>
if there was a more perceptive western made one that captured the visions of america better i have not seen such a film <0>
if there is such a film out there i will take the liberty of using waynes favorite retort in the film thatll be the day <1>

[18473/b]
{} this is a goofy spy comedy filled with asides to greek tragedy that you would expect to see supporting character actors such as peter lorre and sydney greenstreet in but their character roles are taken up by such diverse oddball characters as anthony pass playing a very pasty looking killer a peter lorre type of role as he is dressed in a white suit with a straw hat that has a red ribbon around it always with a rose in his lapel as he takes great enthusiasm in his job doing it with a panache reserved for high camp yet he is particularly menacing as a villain even as he jumps for joy on certain occasions and raises an effeminate eyebrow as he waits in a hotel room ready to kill the heroine <-2>
{} saro urz as mr kalhides is the crime boss and owner of the marble foundry where all the espionage takes place acting piggishly vulgar willing to halt his execution of shanny ford jean for the possibility of a little romance with her as he is seen eating legs of lamb during various scenes while wiping his mouth with the palm of his hand and who could be fittingly forceful when exuding an air of comic sinisterism <0>
as the one giving the orders the big boss he is a less portly version of sydney greenstreet playing the type of role once reserved for the mirthful greenstreet <0>
{} claude chabrol plays alcibiades a character who could be in a look alike contest with other fidel castro contestants and be considered the favorite to win as he starts the pot boiling with his hot tip to robert ford marquand if ford will give him he will tell him where to locate the black boxes that ford is looking for <0>
ford is an agent working on cracking the case of where the black boxes that have been smuggled into the country are as they are capable of dismantling radar systems and destroying missiles <0>
dont ask too much more about the plot it is not particularly pertinent and some explanations about what this film is about were obviously snipped off at the cutting room <-1>
but an unclear story and poor dubbing quality of most of the nonenglish speaking actors does not really hamper the absurdity presented on screen because it is done in such a way that it defies any critical commentary having a dark humor about it that is funnier than hell <1>
{} the bizarre opening and it is bizarre and ticklishly funny <1>
has a magician billed as socrates the worlds greatest magician being stopped at the border as he tries to get into greece smuggling in a black box but gets caught by the border guards who procede to beat him in order to get information out of him as he chooses to die from his own hand taking a cyanide pill but not before he goes into a shakespearian soliloquy that tells his captors that it is too late there are already black boxes in the country <0>
{} chabrol has gone to absurd extremes of humor in this commercially driven screwball comicmystery that has the agents working for the greek government at least i think that is who they are working for the one in charge of them is a lazy sleazy and mediocre bureaucrat named sharp bouquet aptly named because he is a dull wit who is clueless about what is going on as he confronts the two agents working for him the imaginative but usually wrong robert and the more steady dex ronet who like sharp has his eye on roberts appealing wife shanny only he doesnt get his face slapped like sharp does by her as sharp makes too much of an overt pass at her <0>
jean seberg the much maligned actress is just terrific in this breezy role showing a certain amount of vulnerability and courage and sex appeal and an eye for comic timing <2>
as she takes over for robert when he is killed just before he was going to tell her the info he has about the black boxes and they were to celebrate the news with champagne and love making <0>
{} the road to corinthe the european title for the film is the road to the marble foundry owned by kalhides <0>
it is the place where there is this great mix of intrigue and murder and comedy as the black boxes are discovered there hidden in the statues heads and as kalhides says if you think im not imaginative enough to put them someplace else you are wrong because some of them i have put in the base of the statue <0>
{} the danger shanny finds herself in as the villains go after her is routinely filled with one surprise after another as she gets a ride from a simpleminded truck driver justi who constantly eats sardines and could use a little romance from her as she pumps him for info about his boss the everpresent kalhides who murders the trucker just because he kept him from killing shanny which was a visually bizarre scene showing how he has her placed on a giant hook on a crane lifting her up and ready to dump her into a rock pile <0>
{} dex saves the day finding it in his heart to go against his boss sharp who orders shanny to go back to new york but dex decides to risk losing his job by reluctantly helping shanny fight the keepers of the black box <0>
it is a wonderful b movie experience that rips deliciously into the spy film genre and comes away with a bundle of laughs for all its awkwardness <1>
and a ridiculous ending to a story that fails to make much sense <-1>
i think chabrol hit it best when the opening epigraph states i do not ask you to believe it but i suggest that you dream about it <1>
well maybe you dont want to dream about it but if you daydream about it during the time of day when you are a little bored with things or upset over something the absurdity of this film should bring a smile to you <1>

[18088/a]
{} diderot wrote this novel in based on a true story about the corruption and evil in the monastic orders where it was the practice of families even against the will of their children to give money to the order so that their child could stay forever in the monastery <0>
there was no way out for the child if later on the child was not found suited for this life and wanted to leave <0>
this dreadful condition of life is fully captured by rivette as he tells this story of woe in a detached and austere way using the monastery as a metaphor for the corruption and decay of the world at large <1>
this film was banned in france during the s for being anticatholic <0>
{} this is rivettes most linear and comprehensible film clearly following the unwilling nun to be karina as she learns of her fate as her spiteful aristocratic mother sends her to a nunnery against her will because the mother conceived her illegitimately and in order to avoid disgracing the family she removes the yearold child to a monastery and the child is powerless to do anything about it <0>
the harshness and dreariness of the story is so pervasive filled with so much pathos and heart wrenching evil that it takes a great director such as rivette to bring life and breath to the soul of the film to keep out any superfluous material to this already startling story <1>
in his no nonsense hands we witness the superstitious beliefs present at the time and how god was made into the lies these socalled religious people lived their lives for practicing a hypocrisy that lingers on even in modern society <1>
{} as karina becomes part of the monastic order we follow the routines the sisters do and view with horror the sterility of their life and do not question any person who is still sane enough to be wanting to get out of there even if we are shown later on that life for the poor and the powerless in the real world was also an unfortunate one <0>
{} at her first convent after her first abbess who tried to offer her some maternal kindness understanding her situation dies karina runs into inhumane treatment when the new mother superior finds that she is not willing to be part of their vocation <0>
the lack of compassion and twisted religious concepts become too evident to her she realizes that she will never be able to adjust to this abnornal life <0>
and since she went into the monastery as a teenager she actually has very little knowledge of the outside world but still feels confident that the outside world is a better choice for her but will soon find out that the outside world can offer her no reassurances for a sane life <0>
{} a lawyer retained by those outside of the church who are interested in removing some of the churchly political powers argues against her staying in this cruel monastery and tries to get her released from her obligation totally but the best the church authorities can do is transfer her to a more humane monastery <0>
{} in her new monastery she will next face a lesbian mother superior who desires to have sex with her and a priest who is her confessor but has grown dispirited with the church as he gets her to escape from the monastery and then tries to molest her <0>
her gloom now becomes so great that she cannot find solace in anything even as she truly searches to find the god within her and becomes the only one from the monastery who is really religious <0>
her plight becomes so horrid as she cannot adjust to the outside world that she has escaped to that she still finds herself being sought for as a sex object and in her pitiful state she chooses suicide as the only way out of her misery <0>
{} rivette has made a memorable film a grand and mesmorizing film one that towers over other such benign hollywood films relating to this subject matter <2>
her tragic plight is a powerful story told with perfection of style and purpose a story that is hard to put out of your mind <2>

{} who has the right to investigate the catholic church on matters of religion <0>
the implicit answer given by the filmmaker is that the kingdom of god is within you not in beautiful and expensive churches to glorify his word <0>
therefore it is ones own responsibility to find the truth <0>
now that doesnt sound too radical or does it <0>
the filmmaker makes the claim that the closest we can get to the actual aramaic words of jesus comes from the missing gospel of thomas discovered in the dead sea scrolls <0>
nevertheless the church has not recognized that work and in declared the work to be a heresy <0>
that is the filmmakers version but hes mistaken it was not declared heretical upon further research i discovered that the church only said it was simply noncanonical <0>
as for it being unattainable and suppressed by the church thats hogwash ive owned a copy of it since the s and anyone can order it in a bookstore <0>
{} the real aim of the film thusly becomes one of showing the power struggle between the faithful followers of the canonical and those who oppose them by following the apocryphal as the word of god <0>
the infighting within the church has always been of a political nature and it should not be that surprising that the establishment of the church wishes to preserve its power base and continue to set the standards for its rituals miracles and what is to be the true catholic religion <0>
that the film doesnt always stick to its aim and gets mired down in unnecessary subplots is what disappointed me most about this story that could have been <-1>
well great <0>
that is if it were in the hands of a filmmaker who was more accurate in his details <-1>
{} the film uses the supernatural as its storyline <0>
stigmata are bleedings from the same five wounds received by the crucified jesus nails through the wrists and feet lashes on the back scratches on the scalp from the crown of thorns and a spear through the side <0>
that it is only those deeply devoted to jesus christ and god who receive this gift presents a problem to the church when it happens to an atheist in the film which makes the story controversial with the church <0>
st francis of assissi in the th century was the first to have received these so called gifts of god <0>
{} father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne who is a trained scientist investigates and mostly disproves miracles working for the vaticans sacred congregation for the causes of saints <0>
he is sent by his boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce which is an appropriate name for him because his whole purpose in life is to maintain the right of the church at any cost of the truth to investigate a miracle taking place in a small brazilian church <0>
as a scientist he cant find anything phony about the blood tear drops coming out of the virgin mary statue and his report to cardinal houseman that this miracle might be authentic is met with displeasure by him <0>
{} frankie paige patricia arquette is a yearold pittsburgh hairdresser who is an avowed partygoer and a confessed atheist and who has the misfortune of receiving a gift from her vacationing mother of a rosary bead that was stolen from the dead priest father alameida of the brazilian miracle church <0>
father alameida donner is a translator of the forbidden thomas gospel the one that could supposedly topple the foundation of the catholic church <0>
{} within hours of touching the rosary beads frankie is in the hospital with a deep puncture wound in each wrist the first of the five stigmata she will endure for the length of the film <0>
the hospital thinks she is suicidal and that the wounds are selfinflicted <0>
she receives the second stigmata lacerations on her back with the lashes of a whip while on a subway train that is witnessed by a priest who contacts rome sending them the security video taken from the train <0>
the hospital this time is checking her for epilepsy <0>
but cardinal houseman when he hears about this case assigns father kiernan to squelch any talk of the stigmata that the press has reported <0>
the story will now begin to focus on the relationship of the two doubters frankie and father kiernan as they both have a chance to reevaluate what their faith is because of these incidents <0>
it has also become apparent that frankie has become the messenger for the holy father alameida and when possessed speaks in the ancient aramaic tongue spilling out the thomas gospel she doesnt even know exists and writing it on the wall of her apartment <0>
{} the filmmaker shows that anything about the church can be argued away by them <0>
for instance when frankie tells father kiernan that she cant have the stigmata because she is bleeding from her wrists and on all the church statues the blood is coming from the palms of the hand <0>
he responds by telling her the artists interpreted it that way not realizing that the crucifixion couldnt support the weight of a body on the hands <0>
this very revealing statement of how inaccurate all the christian icons are magnifies the point the filmmaker is making that even the eyewitnesses to the event all saw things their own way and to dogmatize them without questioning them makes for a very questionable religion <0>
{} director wainright tries hard to make stigmata to be an unconventional film with a hip musical score smashing pumpkins and a mod style of camera shots and montages <1>
by using many different fanciful camera angles he allows you to feel the pain of the crucifixion while we see nails driven into frankies wrists <1>
there are many other disturbing images such as broken glass moved by a spiritual wind doves appearing out of nowhere ominous bird feathers and dripping blood which add unfortunately to the incredibility of the story <0>
during the sequences in which frankie receives her wounds there are a number of quick cuts between her body in agony and a crucified male and many slow motion shots emphasizing the agony over and over again <0>
the dazzling cinematography even makes the rainy weather and bad traffic jams of pittsburgh look like an inferno while it switches gears and goes to the contrasting opulence of the vatican and the poverty of the brazil village where the faithful flock to the miracle church <0>
{} though there are many films exorcist rosemarys baby omen trying their hand in this supernatural and religious thriller genre this film tries a somewhat different look to it but those demon voices coming out of frankie sure sounded like linda blairs possessed voice in the exorcist <0>
some of the things the filmmaker tried to do can certainly be questioned as to their effectiveness especially the overthetop special effects especially weak was the fire during the closing scene it was overwrought with symbolism and inaccuracies and what might even be a worst cheapening of the film was the romantic suggestions between the handsome priest and the troubled girl who just wanted to get her life back and loves being me <-1>
in my opinion these were distractions to an already complicated story a story if it is to be taken seriously has to remain focused on what it was aiming for and not try to tell more of the corruptions in the catholic church than it could handle <-1>
{} the romantic hints between the two were fine to a certain extent it made the point that a priests disavowal of sex has its complications just like sex does for ordinary people <1>
but when it went for overkill and tried to show how human the priest was that he was more affected by saving the girls life and giving her love than he was in preserving church dogma i just thought it became too cheesy to show him in bed with her and ogling her like he was in love with her that for me was going over the top <-1>
i have no idea where the director was trying to go with that <-1>
it just opened the film up for unnecessary criticism and i wanted this film to succeed without those kind of distractions because i thought it was onto something <-1>
what it had to say was a rational response to such an authoritarian institution that cannot readily accept challenges from within or without <0>
i dont see the story as an antireligious film as much as i saw it as a challenge to having one way of looking at religion <1>
in order to challenge the church there is no doubt that feathers have to be ruffled but as i saw the film the catholic community was mostly treated with respect and the essential need for religion was never in question <-1>
it is only from the films ogre sneeringly played by jonathan pryce that we see a onedimensional predictable performance <-1>
he is evil from the beginning to the end of the film and how he ends up is just hollywood hokum leaving me disappointed that the filmmaker would abandon their philosophical argument via the force of ideas and have to resort to making the cardinal look like a strangler <-1>
wainwright should have had enough convictions in the strong ideas he presented about his kind of religion being a personal one and should have let the quick lesson he gave us on how the church examines miracles to be enough of a case against the church and let it go at that <-1>
{} i was mostly impressed with gabriel byrne as a priest <1>
his lowkey approach to this role was the glue that held the film together and made it possible for nonbelievers such as me to believe that there was some faint hope for the church to actually be spiritual in a universal and unbiased sense <2>
i was not particularly moved by patricia arquettes performance as the young lady who was afraid that she was dying for something she didnt believe in <-1>
i just couldnt warm up to her sexy dumb hairdresser characterization it seemed too funky and since she was the brunt of most of the special effects it all seemed like an exorcist movie going on for too long losing any rationality and prospective of what this film was supposed to be about <-2>
{} depending on what you are looking for when you view this movie is what kind of reaction you should have to it <0>
if you view it as a horror movie then you are in for a big disappointment <0>
this film is more silly than scary and less funny than risible <0>
but if you look upon it as a challenging religious conspiratory film the way i saw it a film that examines the past power structure of the church and the power that the church has today then you might see a film that is more interesting than you would be led to believe by the way it was advertised and by the way some critics felt that it was their duty to defend the poor catholic church from such an attack <1>
in any case i thought the film was not anti religious just critical of churchly abuses which makes it a disturbing film in some circles <1>
{} in my opinion despite all its faults the film is still a thinking mans film <1>
that the church has blindly protested the movie is of no concern to me <0>
i think on the contrary they should be grateful for this film we seem to be living at a time when a lot of people realize that they cant look someplace other than to themselves for answers and people are either fleeing from religion or coming back to it to look for deeper answers or looking for completely new religious experiences drugs cults spirtualism etc <0>
the filmmakers have not disavowed the institution of the church or belief in a god but just question its search for truth <0>
the film raised some serious questions that should be answered by the church <0>
by protesting this movie without recognizing that many people dont want to have religion forced down their throat leaves the church in a vulnerable position no one questions their right to do that just the wisdom of their protest <0>
this film should be seen as an opportunity for the church to see what those who are critical of it are saying and they should not be afraid of the truth even if it means they have to change <0>
{} it is easy to lose track that this film is a serious one despite the mtv feel the movie has to it and that is what surprised me more than anything else about it <0>
but what makes it fascinating is why the filmmaker thinks the church can be toppled by this new gospel <1>
in the past the church has always been able to be astute and coopt anything it gets its hands on for its own benefit <0>
a better film would have veered away from the sensational and stuck to the nuts and bolts of its argument <0>
but with that being said it is interesting to hear what the director rupert wainwright says it was our goal to present this story as an unbelievable yet wholly possible phenomenon and like it or not thats what the film does <1>

[17430/b-]
{} this is a story about two sleazy drug addicted couples the older couple the criminal pros represented by the middleaged mel james woods and sid melanie griffith and the younger couple being broken into the bigger crime game by the old pros are the teenagers bobbie vincent kartheiser and rosie natasha wagner yes she is the daughter of natalie wood <0>
these are not pleasant characters they are sad and funny they are pathetic and desperate but they are definetly not cute or pleasant and cannot even remotely be thought of as nice people <-1>
therefore what happens to them is not a primary concern of ours except we might hope that there is a chance that the youngsters can be saved from their messed up start to life <0>
violence will become the norm for them from the films gory opening till the end of their little escapade into the world of drug trafficking and heists <0>
this romp down this tawdry road fits the acting style of james woods to a tee it seems as if he was born to play these overthetop quirky offbeat roles <-1>
and since it shouldnt be that difficult to figure out that this film is glued to its brutally violent story line directed by a director who relishes sleaze like some have pangs for twinkies you should have a pretty good idea where this road movie is going to take you clarks previous movie was in the same gritty cinema verite style kids <0>
it is even suggested by sid in her more comic than gangsterish voice as she plays with the younger couple that we are in for a bonnie and clyde thing and she was right to a certain extent <0>
this is the s version of that infamous couples story just needing a bit more violence and some drugs to tell its tale <0>
{} the film opens with bobbie leaving his girls bed to break into some warehouse to steal quarters from a vending machine a security guard catches him in the act and clubs the kid around almost killing him the kid pulls a knife on him and slits his belly open <0>
the next shot we see is of mel hunched over the kids bed treating his lifethreatening wounds and shooting him up with some h <0>
one of the kids watching this performance even thinks mel might be a doctor but mel shoots back that hes just a junkie and a good thief <0>
the next thing we know is that mel comes on really friendly to the kid he treated calling himself uncle mel inviting the kid and his girl into his crime organization telling him that he will teach him everything he will elevate him in criminology and become for him a junkie role model and a sort of surrogate father figure <0>
the kid very intelligently asks why me <0>
and mel tells him he cant take his sisters kid into the organization hes the one that brought mel in to treat bobbie because his sister would kill him for making her son a professional criminal and besides he tells the kid youre small youre just right for the heist job i have planned for a drug clinic where you hide in a vent <0>
{} what comes next is a learning experience for the young couple as the kids are treated as if they were full blown junkie grownups by their new surrogate parents treated to champagne and new clothes and lots of dope but the initial thrill of being a hood begins to change for these druggies who basically would be content just to make love and sniff some drugs but are now heavily involved on a trip that is too much for them to really handle <0>
as some of their deals turn real violent <0>
the one with some nazi type motorcycle drug dealers starts off as comical in a sick way as we hear some bad ethnic jokes and watch the deal these two gangs have turn rotten marred by bobbie and mel nearly getting killed <0>
after that mishap the kids want to get out but uncle mel has other plans while sid takes a maternal interest in the youngsters sharing rosies joy in her pregnancy while trying to stop feeling sorry for herself that she cant have children with mel <0>
{} realizing that this crime scene might not really be for them the kids ask to leave but mel says one more job but this is a job that doesnt smell right to bobbie as he is starting to regain some feelings about who he is <0>
the job mel has in mind is set up by this flaming fag jules lou diamond phillips who the kid instantly detests <0>
as expected the job turns violently wrong and things get grave for the two couples <0>
{} this hardassed film is based on a prison work by eddie little <0>
it is only fun to watch in between heists when the couples interact with mel leading the witless wit by being a charming teacher and an unrepentful gangster with no sense of guilt about killing someone or having any reflections on his sordid life <-1>
melanie is comical in her own right as the gun moll with a golden heart who would do anything for her man but betray her adopted son bobbie <0>
the kids are druggie misfits who find comfort in their love and deformities <0>
their humor comes in small charges of underlying truths as they tag along mainly for the ride into big time crime still too naive to comprehend their total situation <0>
{} the problem with the film despite its authenticallyacted characterization is what can you make out of it that makes sense <-1>
fortunately we are given one glimmer of hope in bobbie of all people who is last seen running through the cornfields with a wad of money on him enough to dope himself up for awhile or for him to get his act together and make something of himself <1>
from what we can gather after getting a full dose of him in the film we can only surmise that the kid had better get himself straightened out because a life of crime is not something that he has a natural affinity for <0>
since the film cant possibly give us much to say about bobbie other than conveying he is the only one of the four characters who might have a chance of surviving and living to be sixty we can only hope that this kid with the angelic face can somehow make it on his own <0>
{} i recently saw james woods on the charlie rose pbs show where he talked about his love for this film and belief in it praising its independently directed efforts and sort of castigating the movie industry whenever i hear the term movie industry i can only think in terms of business not art for not promoting this film and others like it that are honest efforts refusing to make formula type of commercial films <0>
i can only concur with him just wishing that an independent film doesnt necessarily have to be youth orientated or about drugs or violence or sex to sell itself <-2>
there are so many other themes out there that have not been so thoroughly explored as these themes have been and therefore for me to really get on the bandwagon of a film such as this i just want to see something different already <-2>
i am inundated up to my tired eyeballs watching films with the same themes differing only in the nuances and styles of their story so that their originality comes intermeshed with one another causing me to sometimes mistake one film for another <-2>
and i think that is the most critical thing that i can say about this often funny mostly bleak derivative film that was credibly but not compellingly acted in reality leaving no visual impact on me it was too much like feeding on junk food and then going home and realizing that you were not eating a healthy meal and besides the enjoyment of it wasnt that great to begin with <-2>

{} an understated masterpiece in simplicity and poetical mood <2>
the first part of rays trilogy the world of apu based on the popular twovolume novel by bibhuti bannerji as ray studies the life of a very poor family trying to survive on an income of nexttonothing in a rural village in bengal <0>
pather panchali covers the early childhood of the hero of the story apu <0>
we as observers seem to become a part of the family and share in their dreams and hopes wondering what can be done to make life better as we ask ourselves is it best to leave everything in the hands of god believing that god knows best <2>
{} we first become acquainted with the utterly adorable durga uma as she steals fruit from the local orchard and is detected by the spiteful neighbors who blame her mother sarbajaya karuna for not teaching her the difference between right and wrong <0>
the mother hears this being said while she is doing her laundry by the communal well and confronts her daughter with this information realizing that she is taking the mangoes and guava to her very old hunchbacked toothless and unwanted grandmother devi <0>
who is devilishly charming <1>
she has gotten under sarbajayas skin making her unhappy that the playful durga loves to help her out <0>
mother accuses grandmother of being a bad influence for the child and the reason she is being thought of as a bad mother by the neighbors so she asks granny to leave claiming she cant stay here any longer that she is spoiling the child <0>
{} apu subir is born and grandmother returns to live with the family <0>
durga is childishly playful with her wideeyed younger brother who represents all the hopes of knowledge and success for this family <0>
she is constantly teasing him but also she shows great affection for him <0>
they seem to have a natural bond <0>
they are both trapped in their environment and have only their childhood dreams to help them escape their poverty <0>
the father hari kanu is a failure as a provider for the family <0>
he is a dreamer <0>
he thinks of himself as a scholar who will one day become famous for writing plays <0>
he also conducts religious services to try and meet expenses <0>
but this is not going well the house is badly in need of repairs and his wife constantly nags him to get some money <0>
he is of such a good nature that he cant stand to argue with anyone or ask for something even if it is rightfully his putting all his fate in god <0>
he cant even ask his boss the reason why he isnt being paid or as his wife reminds him he didnt even fight for his rights to the fertile orchard which would have softened life for the family to a considerable degree when his inheritance of it was challenged because his brother had huge debts <0>
{} tragedy comes to the family when the father has to leave the local area to seek work and fails to return for months leaving the family in an impoverished state <0>
during a monsoon rainstorm durga develops a chill and because the family lacks the proper medicine she dies <0>
this takes the heart out of the family as the father returns too late to be of any help <0>
death has already come to their grandmother after feeling rejected by her family she goes out to the hidden fields and is found starved to death by the children who went there to look at the trains passing by <0>
{} the final scene shows the family moving away from the isolated village their family has lived in for generations opting for the bigger city of benares where it might be possible for them to better their lives <0>
{} satyajit rays oldfashioned and slow developing film graced with the sublime sitar ragas of ravi shankar is unpretentious and starkly beautiful in its depiction of the human condition just as it is giving relevance to the lives of these ordinary people without the need to be arty about it as the characters find in their hearts how best to transcend the situation they are in <2>
this film should be a magical lesson in filmmaking for those modern filmmakers who think they must inject heavy doses of symbolism to get their point across <2>

{} for a film that prides itself on its use of wit to show what the nobility and their king louis xv were like during just before the infamous french revolution i would have expected to be more than dazzled by these nobles with their silvertongued wit cutting each other to bits and pieces with their razorsharpened retorts <0>
instead i found myself more taken with the history aspect of this good looking costume spectacle and was not especially amused by the barbs <0>
in fact i found the film rather antiseptic not a particularly moving dramatic experience <-1>
overrated by some of the critics who seemed to fall for this french films farcical intentions deeming it intellectual in the broadest sense of what is intellectual while failing to construe how ordinary and dispassionate the characters were <-1>
{} the art of ridicule was the sword used by those who expected to gain favor with the king and his court with the hopes of having enough wit so that they wont have their life ruined by failing to respond to someone elses comments in a suitable manner <0>
it was their way of fighting for their position in life <0>
{} the plot of the movie centers around the seriousminded baron ponceludons berling attempt to get royal backing on a needed drainage project which would help cultivate the swamp land he owns by getting rid of the mosquitoes breeding there and help the peasants who work for him have a better life <0>
he is a french lord trained as an engineer but a noble of modest means who must now ride by horse to versailles and learn to play the delicate games of wit at a place where the aristocrats show an indifference to social concerns other than the ones that please their own vanity <0>
he comes here solely to raise the money he needs for his lifes work <0>
{} part fiction and part history this satire as directed by patrice leconte monsieur hirethe hairdressers wife is not completely absorbing in its romantic tale or as drama <-1>
the history part seemed to be accurate enough depicting the corruption of the kings court and his placement of more importance on vacuous wit than genuine ideas <1>
the honest engineer from the country is quickly disheartened by what he sees in versailles where you get the kings ear by trickery or sleeping in the right bed or by deception <0>
to meet the evasive king you have to make a name for yourself in versailles through one of those methods <0>
{} the idealistic ponceludon finds a local nobleman who treats his wounds when he is robbed on the road to versailles bellegarde jean rochefort <0>
he thinks ponceludon might have some chance of succeeding in being witty and offers him lessons of how to survive in versailles such as dont laugh at your own jokes and never laugh with your mouth open call puns the death of wit and remember the soul of wit is to know ones place <0>
this nobleman who will sponsor him something needed to get into the right circles at versailles also has a beautiful and intelligent daughter mathilde judith but who is prepared to marry an older noble whose plan is to gain access to her wealth <0>
now you know shes going to fall in love with our hero but in between ponceludon courts the seductively attractive and treacherous countess de blayac fanny as he is committed to get help for his swamp project anyway he could <0>
his problem with winning her over is that her main man is the arrogant and nasty master of wit himself the clergyman abbot de vilecourt giraudeau and of course the rivalry between these two wits will culminate in a gentlemans pistol duel that is after a series of dueling witticisms are hurled back and forth <0>
after his battles with the nobles it is still challenging to meet the insulated king busy living the good life who is just as indifferent as the nobles are to the plight of the common man <0>
{} what elevates this film above merely showing how obviously stupid and petty the nobles were is that it stresses how the nobles had to use language to survive in that atmosphere <1>
language therefore became a source of power for them if used in conjunction with wit as their class status only gave them a ticket into the arena of power so to speak <0>
this film is also about a moral dilemma for our goodhearted hero <0>
he must choose either what is morally correct or to sell himself out for his project which he considers as something that is more important than how he might be perceived <0>
{} the acting or the story did not excite me enough to think that this clever film was anything special except as a mildly diverting farce which could be at best considered only as a film that had its moments of being a clever satire <-1>
but mostly it is a predictable french farce with enough onedimensional characters in it to fill the court of versailles with retorts that would pale next to those heard in an average schoolyard in urban america on a daily basis <1>

{} whether the story is entirely true or in some parts made up as the director stated it is is unimportant the film covers the intriguing subject matter of how four single new yorkers exist for a period of nine months featuring the real lives of two female and two male actors who play themselves concerned with getting older and still being single <2>
their single scene is provocatively portrayed as being sad and luridly comical <2>
it is a film that highlights the problems that can be found in urban areas across america as we bear witness to the plight of these singles trying to search for a mate through the internet and the personals faced with agonizing loneliness and unresolved psychological problems <2>
that these four are not particularly people that i can readily sympathize with does not alter the fact that this is a very human story being told one that has many implications on our culture relating how alienated a people so many of us have become in this modern world <2>
{} the result is an interesting and stylized docudrama a rear window for singles <2>
the film imitates those famous apartment windows jimmy stewart looked into for that s look at new york city <0>
this time it is not a crime that we see but is a voyeurists delight and there is something that seems to excite us when we sneak a look at what someone does in the privacy of their own home as if we are seeing something about them that we shouldnt see <1>
but it is the four singles who remain the focus of the film which is really not a documentary except in its style <1>
{} brenda monte is italian she does not care for jewish men and will not even consider dating them because she does not find them attractive she is most proud of her big breasts has a yearold daughter from a previously failed marriage and she tells us she receives no child support for her <0>
this could be a personal ad about her if it also included that she wants a guy not for sex or love she can have sex whenever she wants to but for monetary reasons <0>
she wants to work out some deal with a guy where they come to some arrangement satisfactory to both of them but she must get money for it and it should be clear that she is not a prostitute <0>
her vulgar story is interspliced with the three other stories but there is no connecting links to the others <0>
{} michael de stephano is the nicest one of the four except this little negative fixation he has about homosexuals <0>
it probably stems from his fear that people will think that he is queer because he is not married <0>
he is a yearold romantic who is troubled that women find his diminuitive height to be a nono for them <0>
he wants a permanent relationship with marriage in mind <0>
he is serious stable and straightforward and sounds a lot like what women want in guy but he says that is what they say they want but in reality they are really attracted to the jerks who lie to them and treat them badly going after them just for the sex <0>
{} aimee copp has the most serious problems of the four she is obese depressive has lost hope suffers from a poor image of herself and desperately wants to get married <0>
she relates these feelings to her lifetime childhood friend laurie who happens to be skinny and is not faced with the tormenting dating problems her yearold friend is having <0>
{} mikey russo is a braggart who backs up his claims that he only goes out with beauties by showing snapshots of some of his previous dates <0>
he is obnoxious but not as obnoxious as he makes himself out to be <0>
though it is very hard to feel sympathy for him especially after he shows us how he will get out of a date with a mutt which in his lingo is an ugly dog by having someone at work beep him so he can make an excuse to leave <0>
this yearold failed screenwriter and current security director prides himself on being a gentleman and makes no bones about the fact that he is a womanizer and admits that he is his own worst enemy <0>
all he wants in life is to take an attractive lady to bed <0>
{} this film might be upsetting to some but it is a fresh look at an old problem and its aim is readily accomplished as it offers us an unorthodox study in human behavior under the guise of being a documentary <2>

{} there are many stories that can be told in las vegas about those who go there to chase their dreams <0>
this one has a reflective mood and a quiet sparseness to it that gives its lonely characters a chance to either grow as the story develops or for them to become clearer about who they are and what they are doing <1>
{} we can see vegas at night or is it day with its bright lights as we scrutinize those on the low end of the gambling hierachy scratch out a living in this casino town <0>
las vegas can arguably be americas alterego even if that city is a sharp contrast to what the rest of the country is like <0>
but it does offer a lure for foreign and american visitors to see how the free wheeling capitalist country they imagine america to be operates when it lets its puritanical hair down <0>
{} in many ways this film reminds me of melvilles wonderful film bob the gambler as the old pro with style and oldworld charm sydney hall teaches the young neophyte gambler john reilly how to eke out a living from gambling how to do it smartly with class <2>
it only differs from melvilles film in the violence that ensues as hard eight moves reluctantly into noir film dimensions where no bombardment of bright neon from the swank casinos can hide the darkness present in the characters hearts whose dreams have been poisoned and compromised by the dire circumstances they find themselves in <0>
while melvilles film retains an almost unbelievable lightness to it <0>
first time director anderson revels in the nuances of his protagonists with a need for them to be respected and thought of as tough minded prepared to go as far as killing someone in order for them to protect what they consider valuable <0>
{} sydney treats john to a coffee and a smoke in a diner after sydney finds john sitting slumped down and unkempt in front of the diner <0>
he offers to help him out no strings attached if john will just tell what is troubling him <0>
john says he needs ooo to pay for his mothers funeral <0>
the conversation between the two is guarded and minimal and we are left to wonder why this older sophisticated seasoned gambling pro would want to help out this youngster as a fatherson relationship begins to develop <0>
the answer comes toward the end of the film though we never really learn his pyschological reasons for doing what he does <0>
so we are left tantilized with this mystery man and his impeccable manners wondering who he is realizing that he is not a st francis type of savior but probably some kind of wiseguy who seems to have a certain worldly wisdom that he can dispense to someone who is willing to trust and follow him <0>
{} the two of them head for vegas in sydneys car as sydney stakes john to some money and teaches him how to gamble small time a skill he will need to learn if he wishes to stay in vegas <0>
the las vegas scene where the dimwitted john operates the scam sydney taught him is an actual scam of the casino <0>
it gives me great delight to see the casino get ripped off as john works his into worth of credit and a free room and amenities <1>
i wonder if this scam really works <0>
{} a couple of years go by and john has come to idolize sydney as he feels contented with what sydney has done for him feeling right at home in reno attracted to the alluring but dumb cocktail waitress and parttime hooker clementine gwyneth in whose conversations with sydney we get a look at what las vegas is like without all the glitter as its inhabitants are caught in the dark web vegas spins <0>
jimmy jackson is a friend of johns who works security inside for the casinos but who does not impress sydney as being anything but a sleazy loudmouth and a sure bet for trouble <0>
{} the final scenes involve the trouble john and clementine get into after getting married and how sydney discretely helps them while jimmy plays a part in uncovering sydneys past something that he cant run away from as we at last find out why sydney is doing all this for john <0>
the acting is more than credible it is superb as it is just right for the atmosphere it sets <2>
the sparse dialogue helps give the story an intensity that is riveting giving off the impression that there is something deeper happening than there is <1>
the characters make this film happen <1>
it is a good first effort by the director who has told a tight story and told it well holding our interest with a fresh approach to an old story <2>

{} a screwball comedy that is conceptually funny but the more ridiculous it gets as the story picks up its pace the less funny it seems <1>
it never has an edge to it therefore it seems more like a sitcom than a comedydrama <-1>
drama and characterization are thrown out the window and contrivances rule the day <0>
which allow the home fries to become too tasteless to enjoy <0>
{} drew barrymore as the not too swift redheaded sally the girl with a golden heart who works in a smalltown texas hamburger fastfood place is pregnant and falls for the cleancut stepson dorian luke of the married man chris ellis who fathered her unborn child <0>
dorian and his maniacal bother angus busey are helicopter air national guard pilots who attempt to scare their cheating stepfather for their mothers catherine ohara sake but go too far in scaring him and cause him to have a heart attack when they hover over his car in their helicopter and force him to flee the car on a darkened country road <0>
the only problem with the perfect murder is that the obedient sons are afraid that the voices they heard on their helicopters radio might be witnesses to the murder <0>
they figure out that those voices came from the hamburger place so dorian gets a job there in order to see what any one there knows about the murder which the police are not even suspicious of <0>
{} sally and her family are made to appear like caricatures from the beverly hillbillies living in a rundown shack with a father flaherty who is a loud mouth drunkard with pangs of violence <0>
the film touches bases with the oedipal problem sibling favoritism normalcy a dysfunctional family and violence in rural areas <0>
it hones in on the life of fast food workers and the low quality of life in the small town hoping to make a satire on that lifestyle <0>
but the film just cant get above the absurdity of its bizarre tale to say much more about why everyone is so screwed up or make the romance between the shy dorian the good brother and sally feel like it belongs in the film <-1>
these two are not believable as lovers as i saw no sparks flying from them <-1>
also the murder plot is just not that funny and when it becomes more involved it just becomes a sick joke that goes on for too long and the film ends with a onetoo many helicopter scene that couldnt be more ridiculous <-1>
the film had all the hints of going somewhere in its opening premise but it seemed to get stuck not knowing how to tell a story about what the film really should have been about the quest of dorian and sally for a normal life despite their dysfunctional upbringing <-2>
i grew weary of the manipulative mother acting out her revenge fantasies against a husband who cheated on her and her sons trying to be obedient to her in their own ways <-1>
being a weirdo does not make one necessarily an interesting character <-1>
that is a lesson that this firsttime director should take away from this failed effort at dark humor <-1>
{} it should be mentioned that there was one appetizing scene in the movie as dorian escorts sally to lamaze class and we see them go through those exercises it is still a good scene even if it is still not clear why he does so <1>
i just had the feeling he felt sorry for her rather than that he was in love with her as i presume the director wanted us to believe <0>
{} this is a film that might please those who frequent fastfood places and dont worry about their cholestral count and indigestion <1>
in other words the film moved along at a fast pace there wasnt much to think about and might be just the thing for those who would consider this a date movie and not be concerned that it didnt deliver a heavier meal <0>
as for me i try to eat junk food only when im stuck on the road and am starving to death <0>
in this case since i wasnt stuck on the road my excuse for eating this junk food was that i was enticed to try something new they were advertising on the menu but after tasting it i felt it was just like the same old stuff they always serve in those places and i just wasnt hungry enough to appreciate that <-1>

{} this is duvalls movie through and through the one he had to make the one that crawled in his blood the one movie that he prepared his entire life for where he has a role that fits him to a tee <0>
he did everything in this picture including back it with his money <0>
as for me im not partial to these pentecostal preachers and their heavy handed pushy methods of selfrighteousness <0>
to watch a movie which almost imitates a church service in length and purpose is not particularly entertaining or spiritual for my tastes <0>
what this film does very well is examine the character of the man preaching and what affect religion has on the people <2>
in this case it was mostly poor black southerners who attended his services <0>
{} duvall is sonny the apostle <0>
he is a flawed character who got the calling to preach when he was and has been doing the lords work ever since oh my <0>
he is basically a good hearted guy with a bit of a temper and a strong belief that god communicates with him <0>
if we didnt live in a society where so many folks think like him and mistakeningly and arrogantly take the letter of the bible as gospel then he would be considered a certifiable nut case <0>
what makes him more interesting than lets say a billy graham that holier than thou evangelist the friend of presidents is that he has the ability to get hot and pick up a baseball bat against the head of the guy who stole his wife farrah and kids <1>
as a result of this incident he has to flee texas <0>
in any case farrah has grown tired of his traveling act always on the road preaching and womanizing and had lost her love for him <0>
{} what duvall has is zeal he is a nonstop talker always railing on about jesus and satan quoting scriptures offering up the whole evangelical bag of tricks <0>
that he is good at it is not the question <0>
that he is annoying except to those who need to be with someone like him someone who is demonstrative in his praise of god someone who can make them feel good about themselves even if they are a sinner and a lost soul is another thing <0>
all he asks for them is to believe in a personal god jesus <0>
his mindset is programed never getting off the jesus wavelength <0>
this guy would be a real bore at a party or a hellish parent to a child who is a free thinker <0>
{} sonny lands on his feet in bayou country in a small lousiana town where he talks a respected black pastor beasely into backing him in getting a small church <0>
he wins the pastor over with his ability to preach <0>
he is now going under the name e f hiding his identity from the police who are looking for him <0>
he stirs up a little romance with a radio station receptionist miranda <0>
these unevangelical moments of him on a date with her talking real talk were gems and these scenes made the film a more enjoyable experience <2>
it was fun to watch duvall try to handle himself with the lady who was considerably younger than his late ish age and who was somewhat standoffish of him yet at the same time was fascinated by him <1>
it was revealing that he couldnt talk about himself introspectively to her everything revolved around his god it was as if he was not totally there devoid of a magnetic personality off stage <0>
it was also fun to watch duvall smile because as good an actor as he is and he is one of the good ones his friendly smile always has a trace of cruelty around the edges <1>
it seems he can only play parts where he is all wired up frenetically moving in every scene <-1>
{} in this film he has created a work that tries to be more than entertaining reaching for a more artistic film <1>
it seems as if he was born to preach <1>
as for me i live not to be preached to <-1>
what made the picture dull for me is the subject matter <-1>
but what excites me about this film is that i believe it has a truth to it that cant be denied and that duvall has accomplished a virtuoso performance supported by some excellent actors in supporting roles and nonprofessional actors giving the film an intimacy and a flavor to it that is special <2>

{} kids are notorious scene stealers and as sharp a performance as was put on by peter finch nevertheless the kid still stole the show from him <1>
as the native australian returning to australia after successfully building a budding career in england and from working with laurence olivier and as rumored having an affair with mrs olivier should be glad to be home again <0>
{} shiralee could be at times a very penetrating and hard look at a proud and independent man who has fallen more in love with the aussie countryside and outback than he has with settling down and being a responsible family man <2>
peter finch is well up to the task of being this rugged individualist <1>
jim macauley who is known as a scagman someone who seeks only temporary work and is more interested in moving about whenever he sees fit to <0>
{} at other times the film drifts off into soapy sentimental territory becoming contrived and not sure if it wants to be that honest and truthful about the bittersweet story it is telling <-2>
{} the story is a rather plain one mac comes home to find his wife marge sellars in bed with the man she is living with donny rose while he was away and in the same room is his young daughter asleep and the room is cluttered with beer bottles <0>
he acts indignant hears a lecture from his wife that he ignored her as she says to him what did you expect me to do sit here and wait for you forever <0>
he then beats up donny puts the little girl over his shoulder and he is back on the road <0>
{} the girls name is buster dana and she is cute tempestuous and hardy the best reason for watching this film <1>
as she becomes the shiralee which is the aborigine word meaning a burden and it is hearbreaking to see her on the road as no matter what the hardship she shows an unspoken love for her father who is aloof in his real love for her but is won completely over by the films end <0>
{} mac retraces his previous routes and as expected we see them caught in many a tough situation as they roam the countrys back roads with the father getting into a big fight meeting up with colorful acquaintances again meeting new colorful characters going over some beautiful australian scenic routes as the father painstakingly is breaking the little girl into his routine <0>
she takes solace in a doll one of macs friends gives her which is used to compensate for her loneliness <0>
{} it is a movie made by ealing a british studio that actually used mostly a british cast making the film seem more british than aussie <0>
it is a film that disney could have easily made and it should be noted that this film was made into a successful television sitcom <0>
{} the subplot did not play really well <-1>
that had mac being kicked off a farm he previously worked at years ago even though buster has a high fever as the owner of the farm who despises mac for making his daughter lily harris pregnant and then leaving her feels he has to do that <0>
mac didnt know that she was pregnant and that she had lost the baby <0>
{} there is also some comedy thrown into the mix that acts to soften the story as a couple bella luke that are so good that they seem like the were created only for sitcoms take mac and buster under their wing <0>
and some contrived humor is squeezed out <-1>
before mac leaves to get work in another town and buster refuses the comfort of a real bed this warm couple offers and insists she go along with her dad as he searches for work <0>
{} the crises point of the film comes when busters mom gets a court date to prove that she would be a better parent than the father to the child but buster when chasing after her father who fails to return home because he is with a woman gets hit by a car and it is touchandgo whether she will live or die as melodramatics take over and the film is now reduced to being a sentimental weepie <-1>
but it is still packed with enough sustaining power to make it a pleasant enough viewing <1>
but no more than that <-1>

{} this social comedy is a slick sick one told in short sketches where absurdity and perversity go handinhand with the dress which is the subject of the film <-1>
we see it from its inception as its cotton material is picked in the fields of spain to its unluckyinlove designer who created its pattern of imaginary red and yellow leaves on a blue background to its death by cremation as its last owner a homeless lady is put to rest in it <0>
to emphasize the bad karma of the dress it is shown how troubled men created it and merchandised it <0>
the fashion designer of this plain summer dress is a pervert with a pig fetish and to add insult to injury it is worn by losers who are taken in by its optimistic design and colors <0>
{} on the dresses journey it brought bad luck to whomever owned it passing to different ownership many times the film could have gone on ad infinitum if the director wasnt kind enough to end the film with a good old mercy killing of it <0>
the dress becomes the object of the film and as the director and writer and actor alex van warmerdam said we used a dress in the film because women wear dresses <0>
but by making it just an object giving it no other symbolic significance the film has to rely on its biting satiric humor to carry it through <-1>
and since i couldnt find myself consistently laughing at its monthy pythonlike skits nor find its outrageous humor and politically incorrect stands to be paricularly tasteful i therefore found myself underwhelmed with this third film by the independent cult film director even as i empathize with his determination to make his own type of film no matter how it is perceived by others <-1>
this bawdy comedy should guarantee it some audience abroad though those seeing it in the netherlands have an added plus going for them as they should be more able to recognize the cameos that some of the notable dutch film stars make in it <-1>
{} coincidently the first couple who buy it in a dressshop get robbed and she gets extremely sick as soon as they bring the dress home <0>
when the husband hangs it out to dry on the clothesline it blows away and falls eventually into the the hands of a pretty cleaning lady ariane who feels very sexy wearing it <0>
the ticketcollector alex van warmerdam on the train is so attracted by it that he follows her home where she lives with an older artist eric a real cold and gloomy sort but whom she tries to appeal to with her new dress <0>
it only inspires him to redraw the drab blue dress he was working on in his canvas with this brighter pattern <0>
when the artist steps out with his artist friends the train conductor comes back to rape her <0>
this was the most risque and politically incorrect scene in the film but it also turned out to be a rather tame but funny scene after all <-1>
but the humor came at the expense of the pathetic lady being chased by the rapist who when in trouble would shout out im normal <1>
{} she gives the dress away to some ripoff charity seekers who sell it to a boutique <0>
the dress is then made to look more chic and youth orientated so an attractive teenager buys it and in a long litany of coincidences the train conductor is there to try and rape her <0>
this rape scene was crasser than the other one for a few moments it had the same hard edge of violence to it that a film like funny games had <-1>
but comedy is the vehicle here so when the teen escapes from her sleeping wouldbe rapist she promptly has the dress stolen by a homeless lady in the park <0>
{} the final act of indignity for the dress is when the gloomy artists rendition of it is hung in a gallery as a great work the train conductor then appears to rip it apart as a tour guide helplessly watches <0>
this violent act fits in with all the other themes the film superficially covers of sexual harassment rape dysfunctional relationships insanity homelessness fake charities and the poor relations between a boss of the dress factory garcin where this dress was manufactured and one of his employees who attacks him <0>
{} since i was not all that amused by what i saw and did not find the film particularly perceptive and only found parts of the film to be diverting and original it is hard for me to recommend it as anything but an attempt to be outrageously funny without enough substance in it to be funny for a long enough period of time to be a fully entertaining movie <-1>
and it is only from an entertainment perspective i think that this film should be judged <-1>

{} lynn hershman leeson is the directorwriter of an intriguing cyberfantasy film <1>
in the u s department of defense named the ada programming language in honor of lord byron and mary wollstonecrafts daughter the mathematician ada byron king countess lovelace credited as the first computer programmer because of her plan for calculating bernoulli numbers <0>
it is a film that is strong on ideas about artificial life memory and immortality and in the innovative technology it uses to convey its virtual reality story by using the latest in cutting edge technology such as digital software photoshop programs <2>
the film was structured around the idea of a double helix to be visualized in every scene and shot by using a dna image as a model for the actors placement and camera movement <0>
the actors appeared before nothing but a bluescreen and were photographed with a digital betacam and this was then transferred to computer images depicting the same victorian bedandbreakfast rooms where ada byron king actually resided the actors and the authentic rooms were then seen together in the live video <0>
{} the film is much weaker on its drama than on its technology as its characters seem to pale a bit besides the computerized images of artificial life that it created <-2>
nevertheless for computer geeks this is a definite must see for others it should be of considerable interest to the more intellectualminded who like to see something different for a change in a film in a film that also has the ability to challenge the usual concepts of what reality is thought to be <2>
{} conceiving ada tracks the somewhat analogous contemporary life that the american neurotic computer programer emmy coer francesca faridany has with the th century creator of the first computer language program ada byron king tilda swinton as emmy dedicates her life to making contact with that problematic genius and rebel against victorian behavior and her arranged marriage by becoming what is called an agent through the use of a computer program she has created in her position as a genetic memory expert <0>
an agent is supposed to be anyone or thing who can retrieve information and can talk directly with someone from the past <0>
the common thread in the womans lives is their obsessive genius their searing curiosity and an indifference to bringing children into the world and then raising them <0>
also part of emmys attraction to ada is that both of their mothers wanted to stifle their intellectual development as karen black plays the dual role of mother to both of them <0>
{} the fascination with ada by emmy goes beyond her respect for her work and her stance as a feminist fighting for respect in a male dominated field <0>
they share a common feeling about art and memory and conduct their lives in a similar freespirited manner <0>
and both have lovers who interfere with their obsessive plans <0>
ada has several lovers as well as a spouse and several children <0>
she uses all her lovers for her sexual advantage and to tap into their intellectual knowledge <0>
she collaborates with charles babbage j d wolfe who is the inventor of an engine called the theory of miracles <0>
his invention aims at trying to predict the infinite number of possibilities there are in life such as what are the practical uses derived from conscious dreams <0>
as envisioned by ada this information can lead to composing music and creating a poetic language <0>
in a fit of jealousy over her superior intelligence and promiscuous behavior babbage changed adas notes and the purpose of the engine they were collaborating on <0>
as a result he received all the credit for the invention and she was later on reduced to living out a painful existence where she got hooked on opium which a doctor prescribed as treatment for her pain <0>
one of adas other lovers is byrons children tutor but she develops a more intense and deeper sexual relationship with the devious but likable john crosse barlow an expert in encryption <0>
emmy is also exuberant about sex and obsessed about her work living with a boyfriend nicholas j d wolfe who pressures her to have his baby and stop being obsessed with the ada project and start taking care of her health by eating right <0>
he interferes with her work by going into her computer program to try and stop her project <0>
{} as an added bonus to the movie a very tired looking and ashen timothy leary he died in plays emmys guru sims and the surprise about this brilliant and controversial advocate of taking hallucinogenics and well known space explorers appearance here is that he is obviously very sick but appears to be sober and rational in his thoughts <0>
he dispenses advice warnings about danger having a quality of randomness and offers wisdom to his young woman acolyte <0>
one of his pearls of wisdom goes something like this information is like a mist that you have to breathe in <0>
{} by touching up her own dna the pregnant emmy finds out that she can travel to the past and share her space cyber and womb with ada <0>
ada is a broken and disappointed yearold at this time who is about to die from cancer feeling that she has lost everything in life and is wondering why she never was what she should have been <0>
emmy offers to try and save her work and give her the historical recognition she deserves as she tries to get ada to divulge the secrets of her work <0>
but ada doesnt want all her secrets told saying that every generation has to recreate the world in their own image <0>
{} the concept offered in this film of the possibility to retreat to the past for communication with historical figures and to gather information from stored memory is an alluring idea and is certainly one that gives this intelligently made film a highbrow premise worth savoring <2>
what weakness there are to the story come about from its complications in its storytelling and the didactic way it explains so much of its mathematical theory to an audience that needs this vital information made clear in order to help them make sense out of what is taking place but this ruins the entertainment value of the film and curtails its natural flow <-2>
as a result that very riveting performance of a firstclass actress one of the very best the illuminated tilda swinton orlando is overshadowed by the films inability to be more energetically engaging though some effort was made to bring more life and passion into the story by showing both emmys and adas sexual passions unfold <2>
but the story couldnt completely connect with all the characters involved and bring out their side of the story <-2>
if the film remained more focused on adas story and we understood her work a little bit more and if we saw why babbage got credit for the invention not her it would have been in all probability an even better film <-1>
swinton is that good of a performer to have carried this film further if given more camera time <1>
the films ingenuous structure and imaginative nature suffered some dents because it misplaced its focus not staying with the part of the story that was truly unique and inspiring <-1>
yet for those on the lookout for a brainy nonhollywood film one that has an original flare to it this one should prove to be more than satisfactory <2>

{} a delightful screwball comedy making use of scifi gimmicks to bolster its story <1>
the independently wealthy and handsome peter dehaven jeffrey lynn is getting married tomorrow but is celebrating tonight with his friends at his bachelors party when he gets so drunk that he passes out <0>
peter is a practical joker giving his friends exploding cigars and shaking hands with them as he gives them electric shocks so to get even with him they take him to the college medical building where his friend doc appleby anderson is a student and they place him on the dissecting table to give him a little scare and teach him a lesson <0>
but problems arise when an eccentric professor shotsbury edward everett horton who needs a dead body upon which to test his new liferestoring serum arrives with his black servant willie willie best to take the supposed dead body back to the professors house to try the experiment out <0>
willie plays the role with rolling eyeballs and other gestures that smack of a stereotyped racism that is upsetting to many of todays africanamericans <0>
{} when peter is invisible and the daffy professor cant restore what he thinks is a dead body he is upset but puts himself to work on an antidote <0>
the professors very attractive daughter lynn shotesbury jane wymanshe had recently married fellow actor ronald reagan notices in the paper that a peter dehaven is reported missing and when she finds out what her father did and talks to the invisible man she realizes that this indeed is peter dehaven <0>

a detective then comes in to arrest robert for the disappearance of peter <0>
{} all the comedy comes about because of the invisibilty and mixups and the zany comic routines between the nutty professor and his stereotyped servant <0>
during the course of the film all of the following things happen the professor is brought to a loony bin a trial takes place the film is shown via flashbacks from the trial and the ultimate in screwball comedy a car driving scene with a seemingly invisible driver being chased by a motorcycle cop occurs <0>
{} the funniest oneliners came from willie when asked to participate in the experiment by the professor who tells him he could be the first human to be brought back to life by the serum willie says why cant i be the second <1>
when willie sees the invisible man he exclaims well cut off my legs and call me shorty <1>

{} this original youth film that has the look of a pseudodocumentary but is a work of fiction with the nonprofessional actors seemingly changing midscene from reading a script to doing adlibs fails to answer the simple questions i put to it about what it is trying to accomplish <-1>
this is director and writer harmony korines screenwriter for kids debut film as a director accomplished with all the verve and necessary shock and schlock he can muster <0>
what results is a pointless but engaging romp through a midwestern fictional suburban city xenia ohio and its dysfunctional inhabitants mostly white redneck youth who either seem retarded or prone to violence as they are searching for something to do with themselves in a city still suffering from the devastations of a tornado <0>
the film was actually shot not in ohio but in korines hometown outside nashville tennessee <0>
{} the film opens to a shaky home video footage of a tornado that passed through town and killed some of its inhabitants as we view some of the damage and hear the youngsters cursing <0>
we then mainly follow two youngsters the sallow looking jacob reynolds nick suttondiscovered on a troubled teen episode of sally jessy raphael who kill cats and sell them to a supermarket that sells them to a chinese restaurant <0>
the rest of the time they sniff glue pay for sex with an older woman and take one of their grannys off a life support respirator thereby killing her <0>
{} another odd character jacob sewell plays a boy dressed in pink fluffy rabbit ears who pisses down on traffic from a bridge and walks through town playing toy gun games with some little kids looking like hes lost his marbles <0>
korine is nonjudgmental about any of his characters <-1>
but is that necessarily a good thing <-1>
{} what saves this film from being a complete absurdity is the raw energy exhibited by the director as he is on the cutting edge of cinema verite showing the pentup hostility and alienation these trashy young people have <1>
he seems to be painting his words with images of the most freakish things you can see in americas wasteland and not caring whether you believe what you are seeing or nothis aim seems to be to shock the audience and for the audience to respond and say how hip he is to be showing us all these revolting and boring images <-2>
but is that enough to make this a satisfactory film <-1>
{} his characterizations of people are all offthewall such as the retarded woman who treats a doll as her baby or the albino cook who proudly says patrick swayze is her favorite movie actor and she would pay to have him touch her <0>
then there is the chubby painted simpleminded housewife who is sold by her husband max perlich as a prostitute to our very young protagonists <0>
a drunk gay man korine who tries to seduce an encephalitic black dwarf crenshaw <0>
two skin head teens senselessly punching it out with each other for an interminable amount of time in their kitchen for fun and macho pride <0>
and the sisters darby chloe preoccupied with making their nipples grow bigger as they put duct tape on them and then pull it off so as to make them stick out <0>
they are shown in another scene fondled by a pervert who is pretending to help them find their missing cat <0>
but by showing all these freaks is the director not just using them without any purpose but to exploit their oddness <-1>
{} linda manz as solomons mom does a bizarre tap dance and has a strange way of raising her son as singleparentjokingly pointing a gun at him to try and get him to smile <0>
is this funny scene a comment on singlemoms <-1>
{} the film has an attention disorder disturbance of its own as it keeps going at random from one vignette to another without any deciferable plot or storyline which should be a real treat for heavy metal enthusiasts with low attention spans and those who respect the personal creative nature of film and can overcome the depravity of what they are seeing and its immature fixations and be impressed with the films originality <1>
for those lucky souls they have found a film that is a rarity <0>
but have they found a good film <-1>
{} others who might like this film could be taken in by the audaciousness of the directors style and the fastpace of the film and its easy disposable use of images <1>
but to its credit the film does capture some of the fears the youths have about growing up and it does show that there are no role models around to help the children <-1>
but does the filmmaker really care about what he is seeing <0>
{} this film will probably be viewed as one that you either hate or love and no one can convince you otherwise <0>
since i was caught being in a voyeuristic mode by some of the film then found myself tuning it out as i became bored with it i therefore can only say that the film did not work for me <-1>
it is hard for me to warm up to those who kill cats yet i wanted to see how the minds of such people work <-1>
that i found out <0>
their minds dont work <0>
which is the problem i had with watching the film as i felt that i didnt need a mind to see it <-1>
{} this film lacked the needed pathos to make the youngsters story seem more than a provocative freak show it failed to offer some meaning to their life which resulted in giving the film a disjointed look even though korine should be applauded for sticking to his personal vision <-1>
but the final question is do you think the director is really interested in showing us anything but a freak show <-1>

i found toris performance to be lacking in spunk especially when compared to the fine ensemble cast she is surrounded by <-1>
{} how much you like this film depends on your idea of comedy and how much tolerance you have for sick humor <0>
if this kind of parody over the tragedy that rocked the country upsets you and you think it is in bad taste then you shouldnt see this film <0>
if your reaction is like mine then you will find that when this picture is on the mark which is quite often you will laugh aloud and when it misses the mark you might even wince <1>
the real flaw in the film is when it starts to take its comedy seriously and thinks it has to explain itself and come up with an academic explanation for the parker characters obsession <-1>
it would have been better to have just ridden the comedy out and have been criticized by those who didnt like where the comedy was going <0>
it seemed unnecessary to have changed the mood of the film and all of sudden offered some psychological explanations for jackio behavior <-1>
{} the staple in the film was parker posey the princess of the indie film <0>
she simply steals the film <1>

{} james whale ian is the son of working class parents in north england who escaped his early poverty to become a successful director noted for his famous monster films <0>
james whale directed the original frankenstein the bride of frankenstein the old dark house and the invisible man which was his personal favorite <0>
whale always the aesthete and snob comments to an interviewer that he just directed the first two frankensteins the others were done by hacks <0>
he also did some nonhorror films most notable is the classy musical showboat and his most inauspicious one is the road back <0>
{} he died of mysterious circumstances in his hollywood pool in this film clears up that mystery at least hypothetically and probes into his homosexual life as jimmy as he liked to be called is seen in his last few weeks alive living infirmed with the ill effects of a stroke that makes him either forgetful when medicated or when unmedicated seeing a lot of images at once as if it were thunderstorms in the sky in the form of violent hallucinations from the past <0>
{} what highlights this film and makes it propelled on a high octane level is the bravura physical performance of ian mckellen whose presence on screen is gigantic as a swish personality much like a few other great performances accomplished recently about gifted artistic and intellectual english queers such as derek jacobi as francis bacon in love is the devil and john hurts performance of a fictionalized stuffy professor in love and death on long island <2>
{} to gain access to what this fictionalized but mostly reallife film is about one has to look at jimmy as a homosexual whose every movement is influenced by the lust he craves for men and how cunning he is in trying to entice them as we see him at his playful best in the splendor of his tasteful home being taken care of by the heavily foreign accented housekeeper redgrave who wears her cross over her apron in earnest fearing jimmys sins of the flesh will take him to hell yet finding in herself the strength to disapprove of his behavior but still be his most trustworthy caretaker for the last years <0>
she is wonderfully dour in her supporting role <2>
{} if it is fear or disgust of homosexuals that repels you this film will displease you even though its overt physical sex is minimalized yet every nuance of the film and all its projections are about what a queer is like <0>
for openers we have a pesty and patronizing film college student plotinick who comes over to interview him not interested in his homosexuality but in those horror films he made famous <0>
jimmy handles him with bemusement life is but a strip poker game he gleefully says and since the students questions are leaving jimmy feeling cold he suggests that they make things interesting at least for whale by having the student strip off a piece of clothes for any question asked and in response whale promises to answer any question honestly <0>
this scene turns out to be a classically hilarious comedy routine probably capturing whales devilish personality as well or better than the more dramatic scenes did <2>
{} the serious focus of the film will become the strange relationship that will develop between the new gardener for the whale house clayton boone brendan who looks like adonis and has caught the directors roving eye focusing in on his muscular arms and his tattoo from his marine days of death over dishonor as he charms and beguiles him knowing fullwell that this stud is all heterosexual <0>
yet he feels very comfortable talking to the brutish clayton and loves the chase of someone he is attracted to who seems like a very nice and naive young man but will come across later on as a young man with a lot of pentup feelings and in need of a fatherly figure to talk to <0>
clayton is anything but literary never even having heard of whale before just as whale is hardly your prototypical fatherly figure <0>
but whale opens up with clayton and becomes nostalgic about his life and his films more so than with the film student who really knew his films but was just perceived by whale as a user of people <0>
it seems that there was probably some deeply repressed psychological need in whale to be accepted by certain types of people which is why he devotes so much time to the uninspiring clayton it was as if he needed to have his approval to be gay <0>
{} and clayton gets to like the old man despite what he cant stand about him sexually glad that he met someone who is famous or at least was at one time <0>
{} what is most impressive and understated about the film is the comic tone and lightness of whale much like the tone whale used in his horror films which he used to hide the real fear of death people have and their antagonism for monsters whom whale simply adored and would never make fun of <1>
he comes across as debonair at all times even when in the middle of a mild stroke and terribly witty in the ways of hollywoods gays <0>
{} the only animated sexual delight that we see from him comes by way of his exlover the hollywood producer david lewis david who after a particularly dry conversation welcoming whale back home after his stroke kisses whale intimately on the lips as he departs the house <0>
{} during his somewhat voluntarily retirement from hollywood not induced by any scandal whale reminds his interviewer but from his antagonism with the studio for ruining his career by blaming him for the failure of the road back which the studio interfered with unmercifully ruining any chance of success that film may have had <0>
he thusly retreated to his amateur passion for drawing which he uses to lure clayton into his studio getting him to pose for a drawing of just his head <0>
{} there is whale as the charmer which is what this film personifies best <1>
as we see him telling hollywood stories and talking of his ww experiences which are enhanced by the hallucinations he is having of those events and as we see him nested at home with his florid flower garden and the olympicsized pool in the background which the director never uses for himself but welcomes men to swim there in their natural comfort <0>
{} reactions to whale as to whether you care for him or not come about from how the participants in his life view his films which we see them watch on tv <0>
clayton must somehow see something in them that affects him greatly since he alone of the housekeeper and his exgirlfriend sees something endearing in those films yet he is turned off by whales homosexuality but he still poses for him and that only seems to be because he wants something more than the money he is being paid to pose he wants something from him that he is not quite sure that he can articulate <0>
what both these men need is to get things off their chest to talk to someone who can listen to them with some empathy as they both suffer from an interminable loneliness and an emotional poverty of childhood one with too many stories to tell living a life of an upper class gentleman pretending to be something he was not born into but not caring about these pretenses anymore with clayton who is far removed from the circle of people he moves in so he easily lets his hair down and the other with not enough stories he wants to tell can only be a listener and be reluctantly drawn into talking about himself <0>
perhaps both are drawn to each other because they dont travel in the same circles and can relax with each other since no false representations of themselves are really needed <0>
{} real hollywood figures are portrayed in the way whale probably saw them with his socalled monsters boris karloff and elsa lanchester there is a frank and polite distance their friendliness seems genuine enough as there is a keen recognition that their fame and illustriousness is linked together while for the closet homosexual director george cukor there is no love lost as whale expresses his displeasure at him at being a pushy upstart while flashing back to the nude boy parties the hypercritical cukor was secretly known for giving and then we see how distant they seemed at meeting again in cukors mansion at a rather dull party to honor princess margaret which never happened in reallife where whale takes cukors cold reaction to him without any visible anger but shows a great deal of resentment at cukor for getting to direct a lot of the better films that he wanted for himself <0>
{} for all its wonderful performances and charm and probative look into the gay hollywood world <1>
this is not a very important film in the sense that it has little to say about the creative experience but a lot to say about how a queer man can manuever his way around the hollywood of the past as long as he didnt make a big show out of his sexual predilections <-1>
condon has very ably directed a likable and witty film on a very low budget that makes its subject seem much greater than it is <2>
it is as if jimmy whale invited us over for some iced tea and cucumber sandwiches and he told us a few things about himself and the filming of his frankenstein movie before he got tiredandall so all we had left to ponder was the materialism and memories he was surrounded by and how tired and painful life has become for him as he wishes for a mercy killing at the hands of clayton but since he couldnt bring that about he instead jumps into his pool of seduction and drowns himself <0>
{} and what we learned from this biop is that jimmy whale was a gentleman a lecherious and cunning one but still a gentleman of the old school and for most of us we got to know him better than we ever did before via this splendidly done and excellently researched film <2>
{} it is apparent that whale has this tremendous identification with outcasts monsters therefore it seems logical to deduce that for those who liked this film it really came down to what they saw in it how well they responded to it just as when clayton saw the frankenstein movie on tv for the first time with betty and gravitated toward the film while betty saw it as passe something that wasnt cool enough for her to enjoy <0>

two glib americans one a private detective named harwood lowe and the other a perky insurance investigator caryl fenton cummings get involved with the murder case when the drunk harwood costumed as a devil at a ball in nice finds a dead body and when he calls the police the body is missing <0>
{} fastpaced action and witty oneliners allow this hitchcocklike story to be both amusing and thrilling <1>
and the surprise ending is a beaut which should catch you offguard as you will most likely be misled and unable to guess who the murderer is <1>
{} lowe and cummings are even funnier than the thin man william powellmyrna loy couple as they constantly go at each other with gibes and churlish remarks with her being anxious to get him to go back to scotland with her and recover some stolen jewelry the case they are both assigned to <0>
with her nagging him to hurry up as they rush to catch the train he tells her it takes him one minute to strip and one minute to dress that she should wait for him hell see her in a minute as she responds you better make it two <0>

they also discover on stage at the pilgrims of peace benefit that hoyt is there posing as a reverend <0>
{} the film concludes with the third train wreck as all the characters involved in the plot are on board the train as the ever confident harwood tells turb he will get the murderer and he should be prepared to make an arrest when he is given a signal <0>

{} kitano the director and star of this gangster actioner has created a visually stunning original and spellbinding depiction of stylized gang fights ambushes and assorted mayhem <2>
kitano the actor keeps an impassive facial expression throughout the movie as he toys with his guns at play and for real in a performance that wavers between a sensibility and an insensibility toward life as violence though not glorified nevertheless is what is fascinatingly portrayed by his unwillingness in the end to be perceived any other way <2>
{} the great images on screen is the star of this film not the acting nor the story line both pale next to the splendid visualizations kitano creates <2>
kitano was a popular television standup comedian in japan among his many other artistic endeavors before he embarked on a critically successful but commercially disappointing new movie career which started in <0>
the japanese audiences rebuked him for his critique of their social conformity and thusly his movie appeal is mostly with foreign audiences <0>
{} kitano is the weary hitman whose boss implores him against his wishes to leave his turf in tokyo and go with his men to okinawa to settle a dispute between rival gangs <0>
after some of his men are ambushed in a restaurant he realizes he has been setup so he takes the remainder of his gang to hide in a remote beach house <0>
here the film gets playful and unpredictable as kitano has his men shed their tough guy personas and play like the children they really are <1>
the games are imaginative and brilliantly filmed as the men do sumo wrestling rituals and shoot off fireworks as they play war games amongst themselves <2>
the narrative fades in importance and the sheer poetry of the moment is caught on screen giving us the impression that this is the first time in a long while he is enjoying being who he is <1>
he even has a woman there who admires him for being such a tough guy only he tells her in essence he is only a tough guy because he is scared <0>
{} in one scene he passively watches a rape take place on the beach and when the rapist spots him and ironically calls him a pervert and puts a knife to his throat kitano casually kills him but not before the rapist mutters what is this some kind of dirty joke <0>
{} you can blindly fall in love with a film like this for its originality and forcefulness as it allows you to look at brutality without having to offer the usual rational responses for its place in the film <2>
the last reel of the film is somewhat of a meditation on death and suicide <0>
it brings up all kinds of hidden emotions in kitano and is miles apart from any other type of film of this particular genre <2>
by taking the time needed to explore the inner workings of his character kitano has taken the gangster role and made it more intellectually spicy than it usually is for such violent films <1>
for kitano life and death both have a fond place in his heart <0>
and even though there is shown a lot of the usual reactions gangsters have when they are doublecrossed such as revenge the film somehow is trying to say more than that but what that is is hard to say because it is the visual effects that are what splendidly override everything else about this film as there are moments of gore interrupted by welcomed moments of dreamlike serenity all done with magical camera work probably hiding the fact that the film had nothing really to say other than the pretty picture it paints on screen since whenever it had a chance to say something kitano was mute <-1>
but it was done so stylishly well that it was indeed intriguing to behold leaving the viewer with much doubt about who kitano really is supposed to be aside from his hubris as a gangster and his mixed outbursts of violent outward behavior and contemplative inner mood swings <2>

{} so what if the great danish director carl theodor dreyers screenplay written with preben thomsen in the mids is not adhered to so be it <-1>
dreyer died in unable to get funding for the film <0>
what counts is what von trier has done with the film he has inherited from dreyer <0>
right so who cares about his selfpromotional schemes that have turned many people off him <0>
im talking about him saying that he communed with the spirits of dreyer and those spirits approved of what he is doing to change the film <0>
i just cant get caught up in that nonsense for me its what i see on screen that counts <0>
it does not matter how others filmed it or would have filmed it whether it is pasolinis most interesting version of it starring maria callas or von triers take on it that is the better one <0>
and even though both pasolini and von trier are gifted filmmakers with pasolini in my opinion being the more poetical and imaginative of the two nevertheless dreyer is still the master and i would have expected more from him than i do from the others though i am pleased to say i am sated by both these differing versions of medea but in differing ways <1>
{} vision and intensity are certainly important elements in a film and that is what is the driving force behind this film based on euripides tragedy that was made for danish tv <0>
and that is what made me become taken aback by the power of von triers camera the majesty of his amber and golden and brownish shadings that is what made the tragedy even more moving as he took me into the hearts of the innocent kids this woman hung from a small tree in order to satisfy her vanity <2>
it was as mythic as the crucification of jesus or the sacrifice abraham would have done if god asked him to do it <0>
this tale of medea is still a living myth one that every generation should come to its own terms with and that is precisely what trier has attempted to do <0>
{} knowing the story doesnt necessarily preclude that we can feel the story <0>
whatever opinion you might have about von triers telling of the myth you can agree that his version of it is definetly a deeply felt emotional experience one that went to the heart of the matter in terms of feeling the agony of what a woman who has lost touch with herself because of her pride is going through <2>
by emphasizing her feelings as being only for herself her irrationality is made rational even if it isnt rational <1>
through her fall from grace we see the tragedy unfold and the deadly consequences of her jealousy and sense of being wronged come around to its bitter fruition <1>
{} medea kirsten has been dumped by her husband jason udo for a younger and more attractive woman glauce ludmilla whose father is king creon henning <0>
jason comes across as a modern male chauvinist pig someone with cold feelings whose ambitious nature rules his life <0>
medea is the scorned woman the intuitive one the one capable of performing black magic <0>
when told by king creon that she must leave the country with her two sons or else she plots her revenge <0>
and she gets her wish for revenge by sweet talking jason into accepting her wedding gift for his bride a queens crown that she has dabbed with poison hoping that the bride will prick herself on it <0>
playing on jasons paternal instincts she gets him to believe that she wants him to keep the kids because she was wrong and he was right in what he did now that she has had time to think it over <0>
thusly she talks him into softening up his bride with the gift and then he will be able to get her to ask her father to give permission for the kids to remain with him and his new bride and she would be content to leave the country knowing that her children will be properly cared for <0>
{} the dialogue is sparse <0>
the open air scenery is intense it appeared to me as if i was looking at van goghs wheatfields with the wind swirling forcefully in and out of the fields <1>
there was a mystical feel to his mise en scene tragedy was inevitably in the air whether in the distant sea or on the faces of the children running through the fields playing like children do but stopping at times to look into the camera with perplexed expressions on their faces as the wind runs across their blond hair <1>
{} and this tale is all the more a tragedy <0>
because medea takes the children to the tree to hang them even though she loves them both <0>
and when the younger one runs away the older one brings him back to her and her deed is done her mold is cast in stone as she then proceeds to carry out the death of the older the more obedient son the one she dearly loves as much as she loves anything else in this world <0>
{} all that is left for us to see is the final fadeout shot with the disbelieving and enfeebled jason who is left with a poisoned fatherinlaw and bride and the dead children he would have abandoned or kept with him whatever the circumstances dictated <0>
as a result he has lost his will to live and we see him moaning in pain as he takes his life in the amber fields <0>
{} kristen is an accomplished and noted actress her performance was as emotionally and intellectually satisfying as the one dreyer got from his young unknown actress ren falconetti in his the passion of joan of arc <2>
the only difference is that from dreyers style of simplicity in filmmaking we can feel the pains ourself we didnt need it enlarged and magnified by wasted and unnecessary movements <0>
for von trier he must get himself catapulted into the story simplicity and spareness is not enough for him he doesnt trust it everyone must know that this is his stylized version of the myth <0>
{} that he succeeds in this film is certainly evident <1>
he succeeds because he has found the right medea for the part and has caught enough of the mood without ruining it as he almost does by going overboard with his excesses <1>
i am mainly referring to the hanging scenes of the children <0>
he came very close to turning me off as i was beginning to suspect that these scenes didnt have to be that explicit in all its morbid details the idea of having the older child go back for the younger one seemed to me to be exploitive and incredulous as well as unnecessary <-1>
all we had to see was the pained expression on medea and the children and we could have drawn our own visions even more powerful ones than the ones we materially witnessed <-1>
{} the reason dreyer is a master and one of the greatest directors ever is because he did not compromise his integrity or the films integrity going after anything that was superfluous to the telling of the story <-1>
i always get the feeling when i am seeing a dreyer film i am seeing something that is truly visionary <-1>
yet when i see a von trier film i cant say the same even though he is a very talented director i just cant trust his judgment when it comes to telling the story without it seeming to be pretentious <-1>
i am never sure if he really got it or if he is putting me on <-1>

{} an intricate film noir about a hardened criminal gus lino who escapes after serving years on a murder charge and returns to his hometown in marseilles to make contact with his sister manouche fabr ega and get revenge on a crime boss joe ricci bozzuffi who doublecrossed him <0>
it is filmed with calm detachment in blackand white giving the film a taut look as the action is sharp and ruthless by men who are all business <1>
{} gus is a troubled desperate yearold snakebitten his whole life he now needs some fast money and another country to go to <0>
but first while visiting his sister he runs into a couple of mobsters trying to shake her down as he disposes of them he learns of the hit done by joe ricci against jacques le notaire loyer his sisters friend which took place in his sisters bar <0>
all this is done in order to frighten manouche so that joe ricci can get her out of business <0>
{} inspector bleu meurisse investigates the crime in manouches bar suspecting that gus is hiding out with his sisters help <0>
in fact he shows himself to be very perceptive about what is going on among the various crime gangs in marseilles as he begins laying a trap to catch gus his main concern at the moment <0>
{} paul ricci pellegrin is at this time planning a brinks heist of a million dollar platinum shipment and he needs men to do the job but one of the men dies <0>
he asks karloff zimmer in on the job but he declines because it involves killing two motorcycle cops but he recommends gus to him <0>
since gus considers paul to be the good ricci brother he goes along with the heist <0>
the success of the heist in paris brings inspector bleu there suspecting gus is in on that job <0>
he gets lucky back in marseilles and spots gus walking in the street and by having his cops pose as a rival gang claiming paul doublecrossed them he uses the trickery of a tape recorder to get the unsuspecting gus to talk about the heist who names paul as the front man <0>
{} gus would rather die than be thought of as a squealer and the last part of the film becomes increasingly violent and filled with desperation as he escapes from the police and goes after the men he believes are betraying him <0>
{} it is interesting to see how melville could make a low level hood like gus into a seemingly ethical person that is within the standards of the criminal mind and be deemed as an almost sympathetic and at the same time pathetic figure whose crime spree though unforgiveable will nevertheless offer us something about him that is redeeming that even the wily inspector bleu recognizes <1>
this is not great noir because the acting seemed jarred <-1>
but it has a certain tension in it that sustains its somber mood <1>

{} this wellconceived but ultra sugary comingofage film is not for everyone and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion <-1>
{} joseph cross joshua beal is a yearold who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather loggia to bone marrow cancer <-1>
loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup <1>
the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family where everyone is just so nice and affluent and properly religious without being fanatical <0>
the beals the father denis leary and his wife dana delany are both successful doctors julia stiles plays joshuas older sister needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him <0>
this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven but living in south philadelphia sending their children to a wellrun catholic school <0>
joshua the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn is a handsome sweet intelligent friendly and endearing child who does well in school relates to the nuns and priests and talks politely to his wellmeaning parents <0>
all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch <-1>
{} the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather who promised to be with him forever <0>
his answer is to search for god pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do but thats just the way it is sometimes <0>
{} this search for god takes us nowhere because as his friend david reifsnyder says where can you look for him if he doesnt exist <0>
now thats a smart kid <0>
but joseph looks for him in the usual places and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends <0>
one of his teachers is the kindhearted sister terry rosie odonnell who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball making him the cleanup hitter and in my opinion if she wasnt a big tv star would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher she is that convincing <0>
throughout the film she is saved from answering any tough sic question about god by the bell as it rings to end the class <0>
{} nothing much happens in the search for god there is no parody of the catholic school though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god but this is gentle stuff no real criticism or search for god is attempted <0>
what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum which is designed not to upset anyone as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real live angel a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goodygoody <0>
the film ends as this angel tells him his grandfather is all right <-1>
his quest is ended as apparently angels dont have wings and are approachable and god well <0>
maybe thats for another film down the road <0>
this part of the film was the final straw for me i couldnt swallow any more goo <-1>
{} as this film flopped commercially his next one the sixth sense pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose <0>
though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts this director is loaded with hokum all he has learned how to do is hide the hokum better <-1>
well god bless him if he can do that <0>
this is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood <0>
its just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death children in a parochial elementary school or for that matter about god <-1>
and that family of his theyre too good for words <-1>
yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place <1>
for those who want to see something soft without a bite to it this is the one <1>

{} hollywood adaptations of plays rarely come off much worse than this bw one did <-2>
there is no kind way to put it otherwise or to say if only it did this or that the film could have been saved nor is there reason to say if the acting was better the film could have been bearable <-2>
no <-1>
this was a complete miss and the director otto preminger advise and consent whirlpool laura must bear full responsibility for this train wreck <-2>
he took the agnostics george bernard shaws intelligent story had the very able catholic novelist graham greene act as a screenwriter and change parts of it to give it a ghostlike flavor and what results is an unintelligent and indecipherable story one that is hokey and risible <-2>
{} the problem with the film starts firstly with the casting of the two main actors <0>
whenever they were on screen the film was unwatchable <-2>
the firsttime actress who was chosen as a result of a national talent search for a newcomer for the part was won by the iowa teenager jean seberg who doesnt have whatever inner strength it takes to be joan of arc at least she doesnt have it at this point of her career and should have not been cast in that part her shrill voice does not make for a naive peasant girl who hears the voice of god nor does the closing of her eyes portend that she is a visionary <-2>
richard widmark who played the future king charles vii the dauphin as if he were jerry lewis in one of those stupid lewis and martin comedies of the s was not a good casting decision either <-1>
he appeared to be ridiculous emoting in his spastic gestures at the camera as if he was in the wrong film and didnt understand that this one wasnt meant to be a comedy <-2>
the story had no emotional appeal or urgent power and seemed like it was shot by a rank amateur filmmaker who had no idea how to get coherence from a scene and real passion from his performers in a story that was supposedly all about passion this one had none <-2>
it was an exercise in futility and arrogance on the part of the director a thumbing his nose at anyone who disagrees that he is a great filmmaker and that he could make any type of film <-2>
it is no surprise that there was no audience for this film that film critics roasted it and that the everarrogant preminger sneered back at them in contempt <-1>
but if he wanted to know what joan was all about he should have observed carl dreyers masterpiece the passion of joan of arc and he would have seen the spiritual qualities the story was imbued with and realized that his version had failed to capture the power of the story and why the argument against the church in the story means so much to so many and for such a long time the story poetically moved a people interested in those who have visions <-1>
{} the film opens as king charles is in his pjs tossing and turning in his castle bed and the ghost of joan appears and through flashback her rise and fall is traced <0>
{} leaving her smalltown farm and family the illiterate joan declares that god has chosen her for battle that she is a soldier for god and wants to lead the french forces against the english <0>
she knows what to do because she hears the voice of st catherine st marguerite and the angel michael <0>
she talks the captain of the army into getting her an audience with the dauphin after she proves she is a saint by getting the hens in the smalltown who stopped laying eggs to lay them on her command <0>
inside the castle she handles a soldier who is harassing her by saying god has told me you dont have long to live <0>
well naturally the repugnant soldier drops dead on the spot as if he were struck by a bolt of lightening <0>
that scene is my alltime favorite <1>
it was unbelievable <0>
its worth seeing the film just for that <-1>
with joan all highandmighty on her steed shouting out things like i get my orders from god this film was just too much of a braindrainer <-1>
it was filmmaking at premingers worst <-1>
{} some more minor miracles come about as she meets the future king for the first time having to pick him out of a crowd of court favorites and urges him to act like a man and not be afraid of all those around him who treat him like a fool <0>
the archbishop anton walbrook recognizes her usefulness and gives the churchs blessing confirming that she is actually a saint and that she should be allowed to go to orleans in and lead the soldiers in kicking the english out of france <0>
{} another miracle occurs in orleans as the french troops wont fight until the wind changes directions <0>
but joan proves once again that she can perform miracles with the aid of god as the wind changes directions and the men cross the bridge and win the battle and all because they fervently followed her intrepid lead into battle <0>
{} but things start to change as the weak charles is at last made king and the church is satisfied with their victory not wanting to fight the english anymore only joan wants to finish the fight with the english and kick them out of paris <0>
her rulers would rather sign a truce and live with the spoils gotten from battle and not wage the continuation of an expensive and dangerous war <0>
all the ones who mocked charles previously are rewarded by his coronation and newly gained power but the one who made him king receives nothing but humiliation <0>
the twofaced archbishop tells joan if she doesnt stop disagreeing with the church he will have her excommunicated as a witch which means being burnt at the stake <0>
{} well if youre in joans shoes and you really believe youre tuned into god you have no choice but to continue to listen to those voices in your head <0>
{} she is arrested and tried at rouen and charged with counts by the church for being a heretic <0>
the most important charges being that she hears evil voices directed by the devil and she dresses like a man <0>
the church decides to try her in their court while the english in the new air of peace with their soldiers in town await the churchs decision under the command of the earl of warwick john gielgud who presses for her death sentence <0>
what was a great actor like john doing here and to the bargain why was he wasted in such a small role <1>
maybe if he could have played both joan and king charles this dog would have had legs <1>
{} the film tried hard to make something of the trial and the intrigue and irony that went on at the court that was certainly shown in shaws striking work to be a mockery of a trial as the church court got the girl to retract her sainthood but convicted her anyway giving her a life sentence until she changed her mind again and chose death rather than live with such despicable people as her accusers <0>
but the film never made it seem like she was anything but a quack committing herself to a selfimposed death and she is always seen behaving irrationally <-2>
there was no justification for the storys outcome no power in its presentment and its style suffered from an illhumor <-2>
{} preminger takes a cue from one of the lines in the film when joan says i always know im right because i hear the voices <-1>
he must have felt that same awesome egomaniacal power when he put this bowwow together <-1>

{} godard the icon of the s generation of avantgarde filmmakers and didactic speaker for the lost leftist causes teams up again with his favorite cameraman raoul coutard to make another antimovie movie <0>
i have never warmed up to godard films i always found them pretentious and only mildly diverting <-1>
i have not seen a film of his since the s that i particularly cared for <0>
so i looked at passion a film about his love of politics art and filmmaking with a slightly jaundiced eye and i was not disappointed <-1>
i still dont like his style or his rejection of a linear story for a rambling dialogue that misses more often than it hits the mark <-1>
{} what i thought he did exceedingly well in this work was have the cinematography for the film within a film enhance in a very elegant manner the films costumed and mannered scenes allowing them to shine as colorful spectacles and by making good use of the actual paintings by incorporating them into the film using such artists works as el greco rembrandt rubens delacroix and ingres <2>
{} the story in a nutshell is about a polish director trying to make a film on a shoestring budget while courting the elusive isabelle huppert and the plainspoken hannah schygulla and fighting with the producers who want the film to have a logical story <0>
in the background we pick up the story of the polish director jerzy radziwilowicz who is worried about what is going on in poland because of the solidarity movement and plans to return there as soon as possible <0>
{} godard has made a film about searching for something to love by showing that love is something that is essential to keep you in balance amid the chaos of ones life and the outside turmoils of war and class struggle <0>
he says that delacroix started out painting warriors and then went on to paint saints then to lovers then to tigers and finally all he painted was flowers <0>
{} hannah says in a moment of deep reflection sometimes i love what i dont like ummm <0>
an intriguing and provocative thought by godard though i am not exactly sure what he means <0>
but it is thoughts like this that make me keep coming back to see godard films <1>
{} godard is at his quintessential self when he says that there are two rules for the cinema minimum effort maximum adversity <0>
{} for me there is only one basic rule for the cinema make an intellectually sound honestly done and lucid film <0>
i think im on a collision course with messier godard though his ideas on making a film such as passion and my ideas will sometimes result in only near collisions <-1>
i admittedly find some of his premises provoking which is why this film has enough intellectual stimulation in it for me not to loathe it just to feel unsatisfied by all its unfulfilled promise <1>

{} the yearold boris karloffs last completed feature film could have and should have been better as it suffers from a weaklycrafted script despite having great performances from the three prominent horror screen favorites who are in it that would be karloff as professor marshe christopher lee as morley and barbara steele as lavinia <1>
though it is still worth seeing because of its star attractions and its innovative psychedelic offerings to the horror genre <2>
{} robert manning eden discovers that his brother peter is missing after going to craxted lodge in the village of greymarsh to purchase antiques for their business in london and decides to go there himself to see if he can locate him <0>
his gracious and sophisticated host morley puts him up for the night in his splendid mansion a must prop for any horror film of this nature <1>
it seems that bobs visit is at a very festive time it is the day that the townspeople celebrate the death of the local witch lavinia which took place in january of <0>
{} bob first meets the lovely eve virginia when he goes to morleys house to question him about his brother <0>
she lives at her uncles house and is wildly partying there with friends as the two meet and look into each others eyes and have an instant physical attraction for each other <0>
{} when bob cant get anywhere in tracing his brother he questions professor marshe a visitor in the morley house who is an expert on witchcraft <0>
he tells the innocent young man whose family originally came from this town the story about the th century witch lavinia who claimed that she was innocent after being accused by the towns establishment which included mannings distant relative who was actually the main accuser <0>
rumor has it that she placed a curse on the town avenging retaliation against all her accusers <0>
bob scoffs at the witch story and the idea of ghosts being around saying he knows little about such things <0>
but the professor replies in his noted serious karloff movie tone when the time comes your skepticism might be only a fragile shield <0>
{} to add further to the eerie atmosphere are scenes with foggy winter nights a castle with ancient relics the pitch black skies of the smalltown and morleys mentally unbalanced servant elder gough who mysteriously warns bob to get out before it is too late <0>
he also tells him to visit a private gravesite to get some answers for what he is looking for <0>
{} bobs conversations with the wheelchaired bound professor are terse but highlight the film as they are delivered with proper horror film affect <0>
when he asks the professor what do you collect <0>
he is told i collect instruments of torture <0>
{} bob will have two wonderful scenes where he has hallucinations and both these nightmares come after drinking brandy with morley which leads one to suspect the drinks were drugged <0>
in these dreams he envisions being led to a courtroom and the costumed lavinia whose face is painted her lips are ruby red and she is wearing a golden rams horn headpiece and is trying to get him to sign a book as she is surrounded by a trial judge and masked jurors some in goats masks and others traditionally masked for what could be expected at such a macabre event <0>
{} in his second dream sequence he will envision a ring of fire and be taken away to the same room as before where he will be stabbed in the arm by lavinia and will go sleepwalking down to the lake where he is about to drown himself when the police sergeant avon comes along and takes him back to the house and to eve <0>
{} bob discovers a secret passage in his guest room that leads to an attic space that looks like it is the same one he had in his dreams <0>
with the help of eve going to the vicar rupert to trace the records of the witchcraft trial and with him visiting the professors house where he learns that in witchcraft writing a name in a book is a serious matter and cant be taken back he thusly realizes that he and eve are in grave danger <0>
{} boris karloff becomes the hero of this tale along with his faithful mute servant basil warren as they come just in time to rescue the innocent duo from a burning house <0>
{} the films not real frightening because there is a flatness to it but it has its entertaining moments and is a must see for karloff fans <1>

{} an offbeat look at how a somewhat reclusive genius and socially inept private eye pullman as he goes about solving a very odd case involving blackmail and a missing key to a safety box <0>
stiller is the loyal underling to zero pullman around mostly for the comic effect but who is unfortunately not given more time on screen to do his thing who meets the client the wealthy businessman stark ryan and explains to him how eccentric and fantastic his boss is and how his boss will not meet him under any circumstance <0>
like sherlock holmess dictum observation and deduction and no emotional entanglements pullman follows in the same footsteps as the great master detective and like sherlock needs his loyal worker as a security blanket <0>
{} by a chance encounter in the gym where he is stealthily observing stark he meets a paramedic gloria kim who becomes the only woman he will ever know intimately just like sherlock and again like sherlock his romantic interest is not followed through as his work becomes his only reason for living <0>
{} the trail to this bizarre case begins to get hot as he gets to know gloria and she turns the tables on him and starts to observe him <0>
from there he uses his powers of deduction to find out what is really going on <0>
the story is funny somewhat romantic though at times resembling more a tv series like columbo than a movie but in the end turns back to the private eye genre it started out in <1>
i thoroughly enjoyed this uncanny and inventive caper except for the unconvincing acting between pullman and kim she was too lethargic which made it difficult for me to get involved with their relationship <1>
nevertheless pullman was able to pull off his part of the deal he was magnificently outrageous he easily became the character he was portraying <1>
{} zero had a light heartedness about it that was endearing and worthy of that mind solving sherlock holmes genre it so alluringly wanted to emulate but too lacking in overall integrity to achieve more of an original tone to it than turn out to be a reasonably witty film achieved under the direction of the young son of the famous film director <1>

{} a young northern iranian schoolboy ahmed wishes to return a school notebook to his classmate who is threatened with expulsion from school if he does not bring in his notebook to school for tomorrows class <0>
the problem is that the student lives in the next village and ahmed does not know his address <0>
how he gets the notebook to his friends house turns out to be an odyssey of great human endeavor as this yearold looks through wanting eyes at an adult world that is trapped in its own misconceptions <0>
ahmed has to overcome his mothers harsh outlook on life his grandfathers caustic perception of how to raise a child his strict school teacher and the adults he meets on the way who are unconcerned with his problem <0>
{} that ahmed goes on to the next village despite warnings of not to go is a metaphor for how a childlike curiousity and a refreshing innocense is the essential ingredient needed if change is ever to come to a society that is stagnant <0>
the narrowness of life and the barren landscape are excellent props for the directors vibrant themes shot without professional actors and done in a low key realistic style <2>
the aims of this film are set too low to make it a masterpiece especially when you compare it to a satyajit ray film but this is still great cinema something american filmmakers would be wise to observe <1>
abbas is not afraid to let his camera do the work to allow it to follow his student around in real time so we do get a feeling of what it is to participate in the journey <1>
his relentless pursuit is poetically evocative depicting life in its raw elements <1>
what more can you ask for <1>

{} an appealing view of life on a scottish estate in as seen through the eyes of a playful and innocent year old fraser robert norman <1>
it is actually the nostalgic autobiography of british tv executive sir denis forman <0>
{} my life so far is cute it has an angelic glow to it it captures the gorgeous scenery of the argyll countryside and the mannerisms of the eccentric welltodo pettigrew family <1>
all the performances are firstrate its storytelling and sense of drama are done in a classy manner but it is a film that i quickly forgot about when leaving the theater though i did have a smile on my face <1>
and i say the following in a kindly manner this is masterpiece theater stuff appropriately filmed for the mature audience that should appreciate such a blithe period piece <1>
{} into the serene family life in the country comes a little anguish where the handsome and invigorating father edward pettigrew firth is seen rescuing the five year old fraser who has crawled out on the ledge of the roof by communicating with him dog style and after rescuing him he hoists his lively son proudly on his shoulders <0>
a pretty picture is painted of all the loyal servants and the many neighbors watching this rescue along with his adoring wife moira mastrantonio and moiras aging and kindly widowed mother who goes by the name of gamma harris <0>
she is the matriarch of the family and owns the kiloran house where this adventure takes place <0>
{} returning from his travels and other business interests as he does once or twice a year is gammas eldest child and the probable heir to the family estate the worldly morris macintosh malcolm mcdowell <0>
apparently there is a strained but so far polite relationship between him and his brotherinlaw edward <0>
they have different ideas on how to manage the estate and edward is the pious type relating everything to god that he likes but to what he doesnt like he attributes to the work of the devil <0>
beethoven relates to god his music is the sound of god talking in his sleep while jazz relates to the devils music <0>
he is also ridiculed by the elegant millionaire morris for being childlike and wasting his time with foolish inventions that fail to work or make money <0>
he has a factory on the estate which provides him with a marginal income where he is making toiletry items out of sphagnum moss and proudly states this is the only factory of its kind in europe <0>
but his main obsession is with aviation <0>
and when a dapper french pilot tcheky karyo is forced to land his plane on kiloran estate a friendship grows between them <0>
later on the pilot will return to court frasers older sister elspeth macdonald who was swept off her feet by the gallant flyer <0>
{} the much older morris he must be in his fifties also announces to the surprise of the family that his finac a yearold french amateur cellist the very attractive heloise irene jacob will soon arrive on the estate grounds and they will get married <0>
upon her arrival edward is immediately taken with her beauty and her playing of beethoven as everyone else on the estate is <0>
edward foolishly tries to make a pass at her and talk her out of the marriage but fails miserably in his efforts <0>
instead heloise develops a special fondness in her heart for fraser which makes his father even more jealous <0>
{} the comedy comes easily in this lush story as there are the oldfilm standby gags for comedy featuring friendly dogs and an adorable kid <0>
{} the comedy also picks up when fraser discovers in the attic his late grandfathers books with pictures of naked women and reads about sexual matters such as prostitution and lesbianism from a book of ethics that he has no comprehension what it is about but amusingly tosses these items out verbatim from what he read during the course of a dinner conversation to the chagrin and then laughter of the house guests <1>
{} the major tragedy of the film occurs when gamma falls into the icy water during a skating celebration and dies of pneumonia leaving everyone uncertain about their fate as she was the glue that held the family together and it is of great concern to edward who she will leave the house to because if she leaves it to morris he might be asked to leave or have to put up with morris wishes on how to run the large estate <0>
{} the darkest character in the film is the bible toting edward <0>
he is a most perplexing character wavering between moods of being absolutely charming to those of being repugnant <0>
he loves fraser and gives his son all the love he can but sometimes he drifts off with his own selfish aims and refuses to think about anyone else in the family but himself <0>
it is when he acts as a prude referring to a literal translation of the bible as his answer to how to live his life that he becomes unbearable to everyone but fraser and moira <0>
{} fraser unaware of what the conflicts between the brothersinlaws really means takes all these happenings in stride without batting an eye endowed with the childlike innocence that makes everyone feel comfortable in his presence <0>
his comingofage education will also include his viewing of a spat between his mother and father as the rest of the household also witnesses that scene when she rails against her husband for chasing after heloise and gives him the ultimatum to shape up and decide if he wants his large family to remain intact by this time there are six children <0>
{} this year in the life of fraser as he grows up with the fondest memories of things that were not earth shattering but left their indelible mark on his memory such as the plane landing on the estate grounds and playing heloise jazz records she gave him and his sexual curiosity being somewhat satisfied by all the questions he asks his father at least he learned that he feels more sexually aroused when bathed by the maid than when looking at naked pictures of women provide enough of an uplifting oldfashioned story to satisfy the gentler side of me <1>
it should suit even more than it does me those who like their art to be nice and mild <1>

[21985/c]
{} a slow meandering train ride back from the dead for the jews liberated by the russians from the concentration camp of auschwitz poland towards the end of ww april of marks this morosely dramatic englishlanguagefilm directed by the yearold noted marxist and politically orientated francesco rosi salvatore giuliano three brothers <0>
it was filmed in the ukraine supposedly in the same places the then yearold primo levi was detained at <0>
john turturro is primo levi the nativeturin chemist and author of many books on his confinement including this autobiographical look at his observations on survival and what it means to be liberated and it also offers his lifelong take on what the dignity of man means to him <0>
{} the film should be like a meditation as the introspective primo wants to get it out of his system what it meant to be a jewish prisoner and how it was unbearable to come out of that camp and think that you could still be human <0>
turturro plays the tragic role with an understandable quietude his voice barely rises above a whisper and with an emotional understatement conveying a deep sadness in his gestures and deep reflections showing how difficult it is for him to see the light of day again without feeling atrophied and lost <2>
he is the reason for any success the film has <2>
unfortunately the rest of the film as worthy an effort as it is about a subject matter that merits to be told again and again as its holocaust tale cant be told enough to the world for its message to sink in and should be told in a multitude of ways nevertheless as compelling as the film was at times it also shot itself in the foot by trying to tell a conventional story while the more powerful and personal tale of primo levi was somewhat sacrificed by these very typical hollywood episodic scenes of how the other characters reacted to their liberation and with rosis added attempt to attain some comic relief from these diverse characters being poorly accomplished <-1>
he thusly diminished the power of the concentration camp story <-1>
the meditations of primo levi and soberness of the story were the thing to shoot for here and all one has to do is read primos book and see how much more gripping those images were there when read than the screen images that tended to be tedious and somewhat diverting after awhile <-2>
{} the film significantly begins as mounted soviet cavalrymen appear on a hill outside of the camp where the buildings are left burning from the battle just fought as the fleeing ss guards leave the bewildered holocaust prisoners behind who are left looking up in awe at their liberators <0>
{} when in cracow waiting to get a train home while placed in the transit camps by the russians primo is allowed to wander in and out of the camp and he meets in town a hustler and pleasureseeker known by the sobriquet of the greek rade who steers the frightened and unworldly italian youngster to places of food and gets him to carry his heavy duffel bag and sell clothes for him as payment for his expertise in getting along <0>
the greek soon abandons him admonishing him for being hopeless as he leaves him with this advise before you can forage for food you need shoes on your feet <0>
primo is left with a strange sort of respect and admiration for him while also resenting him for leaving him in such a manner <0>
{} the russians are portrayed in a somewhat enigmatic light positive for their role as liberators and providers of food and shelter but are also ridiculed for their rigid ways and for being a nation that is used to slavery as a normal way of life and thinks nothing of the misery of others but who for the most part at least in this film they are shown to have no bias against the survivors for being jews <0>
there is only one incident where the poles in a marketplace shun away from primo because he is a jew from auschwitz that is when he is trying to sell them a shirt <0>
{} the russians continally round the survivors up cattlelike and put them on trucks without telling them what is going on but the survivors feel relieved when the russians are sent to the front and they are left in the transit camps only with the civilians <0>
the survivors just cant wait for the war to be over and for them to get on the train and go home <0>
luckily for primo he gets to work in a hospital as a doctor labeling the medicines and when there he develops a crush on a luscious blonde nurse wagner but is too tonguetied to tell this sometime prostitute with a heart of gold how he feels about her <0>
{} music is the universal language of healing and when the russians put on a musical show for their victory celebration with one of their soldiers militarily dancing like fred astaire to the irving berlin tune cheek to cheek it brings joy to the survivors en masse as they begin to dance with each other <0>
{} primo in proud defiance wears his concentration camp coat with the jewish star on it as if it was a badge of honor wanting to show others who he is and let them sort out for themselves what to think of him <0>
he becomes an onlooker observing the destruction left in the wake of the nazi terror throughout europe as the train is finally there for them and it follows the map shown on screen across poland and russia and when derailed the refugees trod on by foot until they catch another train as it heads back down through austria and germany before primo returns at last to turin <0>
{} a tubercular camp survivor dionisi who is guiltridden why he survived and his family and friends got wiped out by the nazis in venice feels relieved to toss the starving german slaveprisoners he sees on the road a piece of bread as these members of the master race grovel at his feet for it <0>
{} primo meets up with the greek again while he is passing through russia <0>
the greek somehow is running a bordello there <0>
in austria an old lady who wrote a letter to hitler to end the war but the ss responded by burning her house to the ground and her husband left her gives him time to reflect on what the outside world is like as she offers him and his friend cesare massimo some drinks and food <0>
cesare keeps reminding primo dont be so glum it is laughter that is the cure all for this misery we have undergone <0>
{} in a very sensitive scene he meets a guiltridden woman camp survivor who did god knows what to survive in the camp who primo has a brief affair with and becomes human again <0>
{} perhaps the most moving scene in the film or the phoniest which is my take on it take your choice is his return to germany where he makes eye contact with a nazi soldier in the munich train station but the haughty soldier does not know why he is being stared at but then primo opens up his concentration camp jacket and the soldier sees the jewish yellow star and without a word being said on either side he bows down as if asking forgiveness <1>
but for the ungodly nonreligious and noncommunist primo who was arrested as a partisan freedom fighter and not because he was a jew he concedes that before the war he wasnt even aware of being jewish it is not forgiveness that he wishes to grant but that the holocaust be something that is viewed as so horrible an event that it wont ever be forgotten by mankind <0>
for primo levi god cannot exist if auschwitz exists <0>
{} as for the films title rosi explained life is a truce between the moment were born and the moment we die <0>
this holds true with primo levis belief that war is continuous <0>
the spiritual awakening for levi is what came about on his circuitous route home where he found a reason to live again <0>
{} the truce ends on a nearnote of normalcy in which one finds primo back at home by his desk as if this nightmare never happened <0>
but in his last look at us we realize that he cant ever return to the way things were before the price of survival has too high of a price tag on it for him to believe in normalcy again <0>
{} i just couldnt help feeling that this earnest attempt at capturing the mood of that horrific event lacked whatever it takes to make this a firstrate film <-2>
the story was there from primo levis book the right actor played him but most of the other decisions rosi made in the filming of the story failed to bring it to life and make it convincing <-2>

[18307/a]
{} this is a come to your own conclusion movie that might be a big let down if you were expecting to see the fable that is presented here come to a necessary resolution <-1>
but it is a film that gets better as you step away from it and realize how much intellectual weight there actually was in the telling of its austere story <1>
it is vividly shot with a cast made up of mostly nonprofessional actors <1>
as the director abbas kiarostami who many film critics consider to be one of the greatest living film directors around is known for his use of the long shot as he uses it to pan the harsh mountainous vistas and the faces of those itinerant iranians who are seen through the eyes of a forlorn and at times loquacious middleaged driver of a luxurious range rover mr badii ershadi who is on a mission that he cant find the right words to explain fully its meaning who wants to kill himself and whose odyssey takes us to the brown dirt fields and barren hills of the outskirts of tehran as the film is searching for answers to something it doesnt know for sure as it relates to these three disciplines the military religion and science or it could be as it relates to the kurds afghanis and turks or as it relates to ones son ones brother and ones father <0>
{} whatever badii is searching for this basically is still a philosophical movie that asks people what is it that they want to get out of life and are they prepared to do something to ensure for themselves a happiness that hasnt been prescribed to them <0>
it also indirectly asks the question why would any one in good health and being sane want to kill themselves <0>
{} mr badii wants to pay someone to make sure he is dead <0>
that night he plans to swallow enough sleeping pills to kill himself and then he will go lie down in a hole he has dug for himself in the outskirts of town <0>
he asks the various people he meets in his range rover will you come to the spot at a m and call out my name <0>
if i reply help me out of the hole <0>
if i dont cover my body with spadefuls of dirt <0>
then take my car and there will be tomans inside the glove compartment for you <0>
{} we dont really know the reason mr badii wants to die and we know almost nothing about his personal life except when he mentions to the poor seminarian he is trying to recruit for the job that you dont know how someone else feels you may be able to sympathize with them but you could never understand their pain <0>
{} he seem to be an upperclass gentleman as observed by his demeanor and appearance <0>
but again we can only guess at who he is and why he wants to commit suicide to the director it is obviously not that important or else he would have provided us with more information <0>
{} we first see mr badii drive slowly through the streets of tehran as young men approach him asking for jobs as laborers <0>
he then meets some children happily playing in a rusted car and we see the stark contrasts of iranian life such as between the haves mr badii andthe have nots the laborers a theme that will run through the directors work <0>
{} he first encounters a laborer as he reaches the outskirts of town who is on the job but is presently talking on the phone in an outdoor phone booth about his money problems and badii tells him he has a job for him that pays plenty of money but the laborer threatens to beat mr badii up if he doesnt mind his own business and go away <0>
he probably thought like i did at first that badii was a pervert trying to pick him up <0>
he next meets a poor worker in a ucla sweatshirt he found in the junk pile who collects plastic bags for the factory to recycle but expresses no interest in mr badiis offer to make a lot of money saying that this is what he knows how to do and doesnt want to do anything else <0>
{} he gives a timid kurd soldier a ride back to the barracks and tries to engage him in a conversation asking him what his army life is like and starts reminiscing back to his army days which he says were the happiest days in his life where he met the friends he still has <0>
the soldier who was a farmer as a civilian and says he needs the money that army pay is not good enough just doesnt want to do it saying he is no grave digger and the first chance he gets to run away from him he does <0>
{} in his continuing quest his car almost slides down the steep embankment as he goes up a hill where only quarry workers are at and a group of workers without saying anything quickly come to his aid and push him out of his predicament <0>
again the contrast between the men silence and the noise from their work is explored <0>
{} when he comes across an old afghani man who is a security guard for a construction company that has a gigantic concrete making machine on its premises he tries to get the old man to come for a ride with him telling him no one will steal the stuff it is too big besides today is a holiday <0>
but the old man doesnt want to hear how unimportant his job is he just wants to do his duty whatever it may be as he invites badii up for some tea making him climb up an unsteady ladder which ironically badii complains is unsafe and this from someone who is ready to kill himself <0>
it becomes evident to badii that the lonely old man is not willing to kill him so he doesnt even bother to present him with his proposal but he turns his attention on the old mans young friend who is just visiting him for a couple of days and is a fellow afghani studying in the seminary <0>
but he cannot do it for the reason that the moslem religion does not permit suicide and badiis cogent argument that sometimes by staying alive you do more harm to others than by dying just falls on deaf ears <0>
{} at a particularly depressing worksite where the dust is whirling around and the workers all wear masks to help them breathe badii sits in his car and seems to be oblivious to all the rocks and bad air around him and when a worker who appears to be foreign politely asks him to move his car that it is in the way of the bulldozer he seems unable to move or respond to the worker as the worker asks him if he is feeling well <0>
{} the next scene someone with an older voice is talking with badii having already accepted the offer to do what he wants as he has a sick anemic child that he needs the money for <0>
{} mr bagheri baghieri is a turk who talks incessantly giving the film its lyrical voice it badly needed to counterpoint the tremendously impressive visual scope the film has so far counted on to give it its artistic touch <2>
with its long shots of the barren mountain terrain the soldiers train on and where the workers spend their life on and its closeups on badii in his vehicle <0>
the table is now turned as badii becomes very quiet because he does not have to talk mr bagheri into doing the job as mr bagheri tries his best to convince him that life is worth living as he tells him about how his own suicide attempt ended in a failure how he tried to hang himself on a mulberry tree but ended up tasting the mulberry <0>
then he asks badii dont you want to taste the cherry <0>
dont you want to see the dawn and the beauty of the sunset and the stars and the moon <0>
as he offers logical reasons for staying alive that are indisputable <0>
but badii is concerned only with going over the details of his plan with mr baghieri who it turns out works in the museum of natural history and is a man of science a taxidermist who was out on the hills gathering quails to be stuffed <0>
again the theme of contrasts is shown as a man who takes life is also the one who argues vehemently to preserve life <0>
{} the women we see all wear head scarves which to the westerner is an archaic way of treating women but to kiarostami he could have shot these women this way as a very subtle dig at iranian culture as he shows that even educated women who are working at the museum are clad that way and one scarved modern woman asks badii as he drives by to snap a photo of her and the man she is with <0>
kiarostami point is that all women are meant to be demeaned by such rigid laws of the state <0>
{} as i was trying to figure out where we were going with this suicide the film suddenly changed directions and depending on how you feel a film should be made might depend on how you felt about what the director did which was to follow badii back to his affluent apartment in town as we are not shown if he took the pills or not and then we see it is daytime and soldiers are doing marching drills in the hills and then taking a break and joking around with each other as a film crew is talking to badii who is smoking a cigarette with the film crew indicating that they have just wrapped up shooting the film they were working on as a film within a film <0>
{} films are meant to pose questions and not tell stories is what the director is now telling us since questions are more important to him than anything else they make us think harder about the things we do <0>
{} my thought about the death of the linear film as pronounced by the director is that if all you did was ask questions as valuable as they are in the process of educating yourself you would still end up being the idiot questioner if that is all you did question everything because somewhere along the line if you are honest with yourself you will have to take a stand and state what it is you believe and that statement might come across best in a linear story or some other film format and not by posing more questions and becoming dogmatic about how a film should be made <0>
why kiarostami might resort to this form of filmmaking at least for this film could have something to do with irans repressive government and their long list of intolerances that if he openly criticized them it would probably result in no more kiarostami films for foreigners to adore <0>
{} im a little reluctant to accept any one way of making films as being the vade mecum of filmmaking you just try to do what you can if the film has a magic to it it will work <0>
i thought the ending of the film was not only a cop out you dont know for sure if mr badii committed suicide or not but it also took the air out of the storys power and made it seem like a tease someone plays on you first getting your hopes up and then going back on their word <-2>
kiarostami was having fun with the audience and if you werent in the mood for his jokes then you might have thought like i did that it was just too contrived and took away a very good experience i was having with my imagination working on all cylinders stimulated by the complexity of the problems raised <-2>
and by ending the film on that false note and shooting it on video instead of film it made it seem to me as if this was not a totallyserious attempt to look at ourselves and the society we live in as i originally thought it was <-1>
if kiarostami thought i needed a break at that point of the film that i was forgetting that it was just a film i was seeing then he miscalculated how i felt <-1>
but i still believe the film had a potent political message that was delivered subterraneously a message that is meant to shake us out of the habitual way we look at life and at film and fail to recognize how important our dreamworld really is to us <1>
{} and in any case i know from my past experiences with great filmmakers that sometimes i dont like what i see from them the first time and later on change my mind and see more clearly what they were doing <1>
so ill leave open the option that my distaste for the films ending will be subject to change that is if that is meant to be so <0>

{} a great labyrinth plot ala hitchcock as mamet delves into the greedy corporate world and its nasty secrets of espionage and bitter competition and dangles this world in front of us with all its perks and glitter and hopes for money being the big payoff for these corporate types <1>
this nearly perfectly executed film never fails to surprise and it accomplishes this by telling an oldfashioned story without one explicit sex scene or one single curse word earning it a pg rating <2>
the chink in the storys armor is when you see how it ends you realize it doesnt add up <-1>
the fun seems to be in the telling of the story and not in the story itself making sense <-1>
{} this is a masterfully crafted thriller for the s and its new values and lingo <1>
steve martin thats right pal steals the film with his stellar performance mixing affable charm and dark mystery to hide his persona <0>
the films theme incorporates how corrupting the corporate world is for a boy scout like joe ross campbell who invented the process and just wants what is his what he earned by the sweat of his brow <0>
this something the process is what should put him figuratively on easy street <0>
the process is a mcguffin a hitchcock invented term it is something to focus your attention on without knowing what it really is <0>
its explanation for the movie is that it has something to do with a formula that can control the global market <0>
but what mamet really is showing is greed and how that poisonous desire makes the world spin <0>
this is pointed out when the board members of a company want to know how much they will earn from investing in it and joe writes the supposed astronomical figure on a blackboard which the audience is not privileged to see but is supposed to be impressed by it through the response taken from watching the widening eyes of the board members <1>
{} joes boss klein gazzara plays him along without telling him how much he will receive for his invention which is making joe quite antsy <0>
while on a business trip to a fictitious caribbean island that is supposed to be for the wealthy and japanese honeymooners joe ross meets a couple of folks on this island who will alter his life <0>
one is a woman who says she is an f b i agent felicity <0>
the other is the mysterious rich man jimmy dell martin who is seen departing from a boat and could have also come off a seaplane when joe takes a snapshot of him and the girl he is with <0>
dell offers to buy the camera for a but when joe just gives the camera to him and turns down the money a friendship starts <0>
{} the story twists and turns as dell and joe make plans to meet back in nyc with the innocent hero dropping off a package to dells attractive sister who dell shows him a photo of to lure him into making sure they meet again <0>
joe is like those heroes in s noir films who find themselves alone fighting both the system and the criminal world <0>
after meeting with dell and being duped into opening a swiss bank account and being made a member of a phony diner club and having his world turned upside down as he gets involved in things that he doesnt understand he is left confused and unsure of what viable choices he has left as his pride is hurt that he has been taken for a sucker <0>
he is being wrongly accused of a crime and not being able to find anyone to trust except for his friend and company lawyer ricky lang <0>
but he is found dead in his room leaving joe once again isolated and afraid <0>
this pulls him very close to the audience as they identify with him and his situation even if it is hardly possible that they themselves would ever be in such a position <1>
{} this is the kind of hero that speaks realistically to what could happen to anyone in todays work place especially to someone who doesnt play the corporate game and who doesnt know that the first axiom in business for the dishonest types is always do business as if someone is trying to screw you <1>
so when he reluctantly teams up with susan ricci rebecca pidgeon mamets wife who is the new secretary in his firm the audience can understand this weakness in him which is viewed as the kindness he shows to others <0>
this stance he has as the outsider who made good in a world where the odds are stacked against him but is now having the rug pulled out from under him makes him begin to be uncertain of everything as he begins to lose trust in people <0>
and as he wants to be a believer in people he is drawn to ricci seeing in her someone who has a crush on him and even though he is not attracted to her he needs to confide in someone in whom he can trust and she seems to be giving him sound advice <0>
{} there is no point in giving away the story that is except to mention that the spanish prisoner refers to a scam <0>
mamet tells us it is the oldest scam in the books <-1>
in this film it has nothing to do with spain or a prisoner <-1>
{} this tale is more frightening than a hundred action films put together <-1>
it is eerie because the innocent hero asks during one of his low points why steal what others worked for <0>
mamet offers a naive plea for the corrupting influences of big business to stop their venal behavior as he wonders why those who play fair always get eaten up by those who dont <-1>
{} it is a film that earnestly asks why is it that nobody in this world is what they seem <0>
{} and that is a question we can all relate to in one way or another as we are led along the same blind alleys joe is seeing the same things he sees wondering if this kafkaesque nightmare has a light at the end of the tunnel <0>
{} has mamet really ended the film by tying up all the loose ends and leaving us with the kind of ending we as an audience wanted <0>
{} and the answer is <0>
maybe <0>
this is a film for people who like to use their noodle and are able to appreciate films that cant be tidied up so easily <0>
even the socalled tidy ending here might not be as tidy as it first appears if you look carefully you will spot some loose ends <1>

{} what a concert <1>
an artistic successbut a financial and spiritual failure <-1>
consider who was at this day summer tribal gathering at the isle of wight from this list of performers and judge for yourself if it was worth the price of admission the doors donovan the moody blues leonard cohen kris kristofferson joni mitchell miles davis emerson lake and palmer john sebastien tiny tim jimi hendrix joan baez free taste ten years after jethro tull and the who <0>
{} rock fans in voyaged by boat to the remote isle of wight off the southern coast of england and were ready to see the last great rock music festival <0>
the problem the promoters had was that only people paid the three pounds approximately in american money required to see the concert the others crashed the double corrugatediron fences with the local police holding guard dogs to prevent the nonpaying crowd from gate crashing <0>
the scene was an utter mess with bad vibes prevailing as many of the inarticulate and stoned hippies claiming that this was turning out to be merely a commercial venture and refused to pay saying the concert should be free setting up a tent city on a slope overlooking the site calling it desolation row a bob dylan record plays that song as the the credits for the films end rolls on <0>
{} the artists refused to perform without getting paid first leaving a bad taste in the mouth of the audience <0>
tiny tim went out and sang a lame therell always be an england only after insisting he gets paid first <0>
jimi hendrix was too stoned to adequately perform foxy lady kris kristofferson got into a snit as desolation row pounded on the metal fences and walked off stage before he could finish me and bobby mcgee <0>
a bloated jim morrison of the doors who along with hendrix performed their last stage concerts ever seemed to be musically flat <0>
an intruder rushes the stage during joni mitchells woodstock number and rattles her so much that her voice is quivering as she attempts to talk to the crowd like a substitute teacher would to an unruly class <0>
joan baez looking outofplace with this generation of hippies tells the interviewer she cannot be forced into giving a free concert by the crowd <0>
the obnoxious announcer rikki farr goes so far as calling the crowd pigs wavering back and forth between conjoling and chiding them with neither strategy doing anything but creating more bad feelings <0>
the promoters were amateurs not knowing how to control the crowd or financially run a concert and to the bargain were sending off a contradictory message for a concert that was supposed to manifest love and peace <0>
{} the crowd shots showed rampant hashish smoke and psychedelic drugs being ingested nudity the potential for a riot and talk among the concert goers that this was a just a money thing as the feelings of idealism or another woodstock which was only one year earlier seemed like ancient history <0>
one of the outlandish comments from a stoned concert goer was this is a psychedelic concentration camp <0>
{} the director of this film had to wait years after the concert to release the movie as the promoters went bellyup over the concert <0>
what is suprisingly good is the sound of the film and the high quality of the music <1>
this film was no woodstock but it had a charm of its own and is certainly worth seeing not only for the music but for the history of the period <2>
{} an opposite reaction to most of the views heard is from the local police who seem to detest the crowd and a character who says he is a retired commodore in british intelligence as he proves that he probably was that as he babbles foolishly on saying that he hates to see the youth of the country wasting away and that behind the hippie movement is black power and behind them is communism <0>
{} the following are some of the things that went right with the concert emerson lake and palmer put on a fireworks display on stage the stage nearly burnt down as they were really into it as they performed pictures at an exhibition <0>
john sebastien had the hippie drug culture mood down pat as he related well to the crowd singing red eye express <0>
the moody blues sang a great rendition of white satin <0>
leonard cohen was his usual sardonic and sobering poetic self as he sang suzanne <0>
all this in a concert that signaled the end of an era and the dark nixon days that lie ahead with the viet nam war continuing and the mood of the youthful generations of both great britain and america becoming even more polarized with the older generation <0>

{} i only know for sure that this is a revenge type of film and that it plays much like many a classical western but is shot in the s style of point blank and is scripted by lem dobbs most probably for the entertainment value it provides <0>
i also know that a limey is a slang term for a brit and that he is played with a bravura performance by terence stamp <0>
stamp is so good here with his fiery blue eyes intimidating tone and hollowed cheekbones jutting out from his intense face playing an excon who we only know as wilson and who is yearsold and just got out of the can in england after doing years for armed robbery <0>
we see him on a plane from london to los angeles to find out how his daughter jenny melissa died while he was away not believing for one moment her death was a result of a car accident <0>
{} the story frequently goes from what he is thinking to some flashback to some future thing he wants to do therefore the time sequence is often confusing <0>
but what remains riveting is the singleminded purpose he has as he tries to understand what happened to his daughter through his conversations with two of her friends the middleaged acting coach for his daughter elaine warren who tells him his daughter says she considered her father to be a ghost in her life and the burly heavily tattooed mexicanamerican eddie guzman who felt sorry for her and as an excon himself identified with wilson therefore he writes wilson in prison about her death <0>
wilson also tries to find out what happened to his daughter through a trucking business that is gangster operated and the conversation with the surly men there takes a more violent turn resulting in the typical crime film rub out scene <0>
the only thing of interest is that you have this elderly guy going after these younger hoods and you cant help feeling that when he kills them that they got what they deserved <0>
{} if there is supposed to be a deeper meaning than revenge in this very titillating feature it is hard to say what that deeper meaning is unless from all the garbled cockney sayings by wilson this is a film about what the meaning of ones life is as a senior citizen who had plenty of time by himself to give the question adequate thought as we see that he from timetotime reflects on that subject <0>
{} in any case this film seems to be all style and that style is wonderful to behold <1>
it is also a film about nostalgia as it brings back haunting memories of a time that was intermixed with hope and confusion <0>
the s are dismissed here as only being what happened in and early and that golden hippie age is further reduced to a few golden moments of feeling free through the promising new music arriving on the scene <0>
at least this is the view of peter fonda who plays terry valentine a wealthy rock music promoter the supposed reason for wilson coming to america as he was jennys boyfriend when she died and is his prime suspect as her killer <0>
fonda is the slick manipulator of the times who now has a few palatial homes and enough money to be thought of as a bigtime operator though there seems to be some trouble in his paradise as he is laundering dirty money for drug dealers and is constantly looking over his shoulder at what trouble lies ahead <0>
he is very convincing as a slimeball and i liked peeking into his closet which is bigger than most peoples apartments with all those shoes and sweaters and i shouldnt forget that splendid pool and that panoramic view his ultramodern house has from the top of the los angeles hills indicating that he is someone who is doing very well <0>
{} steven sodergergh sex lies and videotapekafkaschizopolisout of sight has a way of making quirky films that border on the mundane but offer promises of much more <0>
in this film he engages several intriguing possibilities and plays them out to the hilt he has his two major stars fonda and stamp who were both born in and both played innocent antihero types in the s fonda as the biker drug dealer in easy rider and stamp in billy budd be pitted against each other <0>
in addition stamp had a role in as a thief called wilson in the first feature by ken loach poor cow <0>
these byplays to the film add some questions to what went wrong with the s as it seems to ask in the film how does wilson end up doing hard time in prison robbing the ticket office of a rock concert while valentine remains stuck in a time warp making big money by still packaging that same music still going after beautiful young girls this time replacing jenny with another livein beauty adhara amelia and crossing the line of innocence in drugs by becoming a party to the bigtime criminal aspect of the drug business as money is his lure and no other pretences of becoming a better person is given <0>
the director makes frequent flashback cuts to the stamp of younger film days using the film he was in as it becomes more and more evident that this film has many purposes to it not excluding the former reallife film roles of its present iconic stars and how they are now portrayed onscreen <0>
{} as wilson and valentine square off with each other through wilsons bitter way of looking at him we get to view his take on valentines hollywood lifestyle as he visits him in his los angeles canyon home and meets his entourage full blast <0>
the first one he meets is his shady lawyer adviser who is paid to protect him from the unseemly side to his business barry newman as the ish avery who plays his role as a villain with an intractable mindset <0>
his first attempt to get wilson removed from the party results in his security man being fatally thrown down the canyon by the limey <0>
there is also a colorful hitman that avery hires to get wilson stacy katt someone in love with his image of being a hitman who has the funniest joke in the film that is tasteless and irresistible what is the smartest thing to come out of a womans mouth <0>
answer einsteins cock <0>
{} the filmgoer gets a lot for his price of admission here a great performance by the actors a pleasing revenge film with all the usual action sequences and a twist in the plot to keep the viewer further enthralled its a film that has all the techniques of the french new wave filming style with jump cuts and a fastmoving camera to keep the viewer guessing whats coming next as he is kept adequately confused so that he thinks he is missing something and should see the film again and the viewer also gets the promise that this baby has something wise to say which it appears to be on the verge of saying at times but i would say it is safer to believe that this film is style over substance and in this case that is not all that bad <1>
perhaps the s itself was mostly an innocent call for a better world that was manipulated by those who knew better like the terry valentines of the world <-1>
therefore style over substance isnt all that bad a message for this intensely shot nouveaunoir work that seemed to be saying something like that or maybe its just that the kings english even when spoken by a common criminal in a rich cockney accent sounds so worthwhile that i have been so duly conditioned to believe that about the english language that i would listen keenly to anyone who spoke like that and believe i was listening to something philosophical <1>

{} david lynch eraserheadlost highwayblue velvetwild at hearttwin peaks switches filmmaking gears and goes from his hipster style of making weirdo films to making a simple heartrendering story of a yearold from laurens iowa alvin straight farnsworthhes actually who rides his ancient rehds lawnmower with a trailer hitched to it until that breaks down and he has to splurge for and get a john deere to take him the miles he needs to go which takes a little over five weeks to see his brother lyle stanton in mount zion wisconsin <0>
{} the film is most like a timeless spiritual quest something alvin feels he has to do in order to make peace with himself and with his brother <0>
this is after a bitter argument which kept him from not seeing or hearing from him for the last years but now he learns that his brother has just suffered a stroke <0>
{} alvins mentally impaired daughter rose sissy lives with him after the state took away her four kids due to a fire in the house even though it was not her fault as alvin adds she got a raw deal from the state though there seems to be no bitterness in his tone <0>
{} alvins eyesight is so poor that he doesnt have a drivers license he walks with a cane has a bad hip has emphysema and is as stubborn as a mule therefore even though it doesnt make too much sense to travel the way he does no one can talk him out of it <0>
he will not have his daughter drive him or take a bus or let a stranger he meets on the road take him there he feels that this is something he just has to do by himself <0>
{} the film reeks of midwestern wholesomeness folksiness and homespun philosophies <1>
that it works so well is a testament to richard farnsworths compelling characterization and the flavor the film captures of the genuine straight people playing straight man to alvin straight on the twolane highway he takes across the mississippi river to wisconsin <0>
it features a road show of ordinary folks consisting of those who can be kind to a stranger who is doing something he probably ought not be doing <0>
their ordinary lives are put under the microscope in a slowmoving tale that is not in a hurry to get to the end of its journey as the strangers talk to each other seriously listen to each other and we as an audience get to know all of them reasonably well <0>
as a change of pace american viewers might welcome a pause from all the action films and whacky stories they are inundated with and take a reality check to see if they are interested in seeing a film that most of them could have been in <1>
{} this is a fictionalized version of a true story that took place in septemberoctober of and was discovered by the screenwriters from an article in the n y times <0>
{} the film plays as if it was a foreign film since it is rare for an american film to be so selfconscious of itself so interested in just looking at the open blue sky the blowing wheatfields the bare streets of a sleepy town and having its star find peace with himself without any reason or big event in the film <0>
it is also a film that knows how to keep proper time with its slowmoving story and the slowmoving transport of its hero <1>
by doing this it suggests that his life can be carefully digested without everything being brought to a conclusion before it needs to be <0>
{} some of the vignettes worked better than others but what was always convincing was how the unsophisticated but straightforward manner of farnsworth came across in such an appealing way a way many americans would like to think of themselves as actually being <1>
{} his encounter with a runaway young pregnant hitchhiker whom he advises to go back home seemed too pat for it to be a moving experience as true as her sad story might be and as good as his advise to her was <1>
yet lynch handled it correctly by just indicating by her changing facial expressions that something was clicking inside her and that she was becoming less confused about what to do and by having her symbolically show that she understood what alvin told her to do <0>
his encounter with an hysterical lady who keeps hitting deer with her car on her way to work also seemed too overblown a situation to even comment on his failure to ease her anguish <0>
fortunately nothing much is made of this event except alvin has the common sense to have some deer meat for his nightly camp fire <0>
but when alvins tractor belt breaks going down a steep hill and he is shaken he is befriended by danny riordan cada a retired john deere employee who was at the time watching a practice fire exercise in this sleepy town <0>
he looks upon alvin as the national treasure he is taking alvin back to his yard to camp out while he gets the towns mechanics bickering twins to repair the tractor as alvin has a go at getting the brothers to relate to each other in a more amiable manner <0>
{} the film moves into territory where people of good nature really communicate with each other and offer whatever support they can to each other and it is the right support because they have tapped into the source that gives them such character which is what the kindly relationship that developed between danny and alvin offered <0>
alvin also meets an oldtimer he instantly relates to and since this is an odyssey where one of its primary purposes is of reliving the past and alvin throughout the journey is bringing up tidbits about his life what comes up now is the dark secret from his days fighting in ww something he couldnt tell anyone it is when he was a sniper and had the misfortune of unknowingly killing someone on his side and who better to tell this too than this ww veteran with such a kindly face who quietly understood everything alvin was saying knowing fullwell how farm boys came back from the war with images of the horrors they had been through and couldnt face themselves anymore and took to drinking <0>
alvin has already faced his drinking problem and now that he has confessed to what has been eating away at him all these years he seems to be ready to fulfill his life by just seeing his brother again and making peace with him <0>
{} he will encounter a priest when he camps out on one of the oldest cemeteries in wisconsin and they will have a friendly discussion about religion indicating that theres not much difference between alvins baptist faith and the priests catholicism <0>
his last meaningful encounter before he ends up on the porch of his brothers shack and is looking up at the night sky is with an oldtime bartender who serves him a miller light and gracefully talks the friendly chatter barkeeps throughout the country are known for <0>
{} this film was just right for what it wanted to do it felt good seeing alvins journey find closure <1>
the sentimentality of the film was kept to the minimum and lynch did not try to make this small story grander than what it was and thats a good thing because the smallness of the story is what made this film seem so elegant and it is also what made it seem epic <2>
{} but in a film that goes only surface deep in uncovering the mythos about smalltown america and its elderly it becomes unfortunate that the filmmaker couldnt delve deeper and get more out of the story as it seems as if this is a story waiting to be pried open even wider by someone who is not stuck on what seems to be the obvious but wants to make some waves with the politics of such smalltown conservatism and question why the towns look so dry and shrivelledup the people seem so unintellectual and the places visited so dull notwithstanding how kindly its citizens can act in an emergency <-1>
after initially being very pleased with the film i got to wondering what i learned about alvin straight that i didnt know when the film began and though i thought that alvins reflections about his life were genuine i still didnt really know what he is all about by the films end even if i now knew his darkest secret and that is what troubles me most about this film <-1>
{} there is something about his life that makes me think of alvin as not only a likable character which is what i found him to be but someone who is so setinhisways that he cannot evolve further and he is someone who is so accepting of the american way of life that it seems a shame that he cant find anything to say that questions the america and its institutions he was prepared to give his life for during ww <1>
lynch seems to have created a character that buys into all the oldtraditional values america supposedly cherishes but without reexamining them such as family values religious institutions and the military <-1>
he would be someone who would make a good poster boy for the religious right <1>
there seems to be no rebel in alvin as lynch seems to accept his status quo without any hesitation <0>
{} alvin for all his appeal just seems to be another blind follower of the socalled american value system <-1>
it was difficult for me to see lynchs motivations for making this simple story without offering any ruffles in the feathers of the american eagle <-1>
though he certainly has a right to see things the way he does it nevertheless is disconcerting to see a film that is so accepting of the institutional american values without even questioning them <-1>
{} if this film was meant as a religious quest then it failed in that venture especially when compared to the lives of other religious figures autobiographies who had to fight the conformity of society and their own inner being until they were able through their journey to raise their consciousness <-1>
but if this is just a mild tale about an oldtimer doing something a little ornery then it works and is pleasant to look at just like it is pleasant to have a conversation on main street with some real people <1>
it makes you feel good but is that challenging enough <0>
{} i still dont know what lynchs motivation is for making this walt disney family value production film except it seems to be an ode to traditional values which seems odd coming from him especially since he is known rightly or wrongly for making films that are supposed to be onthecuttingedge <-1>
there was nothing daring about this film as its appeal is mostly through the magnificent performance of richard farnsworth who is a movic relic chiseled in dignity with his weatherbeaten face and his geezerlike sensibilities shining through <1>
he is someone beyond acting criticism and whatever failings or misplaced points there are to his story the film is still a relatively interesting work retaining something about the american mythos that is worth investigating further this is a film that is wellcrafted and wellworth seeing and this is so because lynch knows how to film a story in a thoroughly professional manner <2>
as for lynch personally i dont have the foggiest idea what his real beliefs are or what his changing career moves might mean but as far as this film goes he seems to be very accepting of the status quo <0>

{} a realistic hardboiled peek at an old irish closeknit neighborhood in bostons bluecollar charlestown section <0>
the neighborhood is beginning to change a bit with yuppies moving in nearby and then there is the more dangerous threat to them of blacks possibly moving in <0>
this is upsetting to these insulated residents fearful of what they dont and cant understand <0>
the focus of the film is on bobby ogrady denis who is living with his mum while being unemployed and hanging out with mousey ian and his cousin from dublin jason seamus and his other bar cohorts <0>
they steal cars for the local crime boss of the area known as jackie o colm who tightly controls the neighborhood with a menacing friendliness <0>
jackie o strictly enforces the code of the neighborhood making sure that no one squeals to the cops <0>
his motto is loyalty is what counts the most <0>
{} what makes this overused type of storyline for many recent films stand out from the rest is that there is no mistake this is the actual mentality of the neighborhood <0>
the film is seen through the eyes of bobby the films lowlife protagonist <0>
we are stuck with him perhaps to a certain extent even commiserating with him seeing that he cant escape from being born into a life of crime even if he has a good mum and doesnt appear to be a really bad sort of a person just a little wild and rough in spots <0>
his main problem seems to be that he has no one around to point him in the right direction <0>
the one person jason whom he could talk to he cant because jason could only express his anguish that things are rotten over here and he does not find bobby to be receptive to what he says about altering his behavior <0>
that is the deep sadness about the film it traps everyone into its malaise and we feel that there can be no getting out of the neighborhood or the criminal ways these street people cling to <0>
it all seems so pointless <-1>
{} when jackie o starts rubbing out those close to bobby just on the perception that they might have said something to the police bobby starts a slow boil <0>
he is unable to think straight about what he should do but breaking the code of silence is never one of his options <0>
thrown into the mix is a sexy neighborhood girl who is a bit of a headcase herself katy famke <0>
she is jackie os girl but is seeing bobby on the side and is extremely jealous if bobby goes after any other girl <0>
this is evident in the scene that really summarizes the direction the story is going when bobby out of frustration at seeing jackie o and katy together at the local bar they hang out in decides to pickup an attractive yuppie annie jeanne <0>
she came into the local bar out of curiosity <0>
this pickup does not go well and he is rejected by her <0>
then the most annoying and daring scene in the film takes place as he goes riding with his pals and they spot a black man in their neighborhood and even though nothing comes of this as far as going through with the actual violence they threaten him with but the overt violence and hatred shown to this outsider clearly shows how narrow their lives are <0>
this incident becomes transfixed on our protagonist forever forewarning us that there is no way out for him <0>
{} monument ave works well as a potently atmospheric film that captures the mood of a neighborhood but cannot penetrate the souls of the individuals who live there <1>
the boundary line from yuppieville to bluecollarville is monument ave and our boy cant cross the boundary line that is without being thieves <0>
{} there is a prevailing emptiness in their lives <0>
when they have inane conversations about movie stars tits and their frivolous neighborhood adventures while snorting coke and getting boozed up it all seems to be a tragically wasteful way of life <0>
even with all their bravado they feel and act like losers <0>
the irish cop hanlon sheen knows them as well as any outsider really can having grown up in the hood even though he now lives in the more affluent suburbs <0>
he knows them from his dealings with them that their code of silence is all that one can expect from them <0>
{} the power of the story has stalled out somewhere in the midst of all the turbulence in the young men lives leaving them with no place to go after all the cursing and shooting pauses for a break <0>
as the message is simply that nothing changes here <0>
if you dont go along with the way things are done by the crime bosses your only other choice is a deadend job <0>
{} bobby has this anguished look on his face as he does what he has to do and is as successful as he will ever be in his lifetime after he settles his old debts the only way he knows how to and his friends drink a toast to him and the inane bar conversation mixes in with the bar music as the picture fades out on this insightful but unfulfilling film <1>

{} an existential mystery story about someone getting away with murder some years ago when the now police commissioner hans barlach ritt and the now wealthy and wellconnected businessman richard gastmann shaw were young men and gastmann made a bet with barlach that he could kill someone and get away with it <0>
he seemingly punched a girl named nadine they were both romantically interested in and she fell in the water to drown <0>
{} at present in berne switzerland where walter thschanz voight is called back from his vacation to help the dying police commissioner solve the murder of a policeman played by donald sutherland who was working undercover on a special assignment for the commissioner to spy on gastmann at his country estate <0>
barlach in the meantime is most concerned with his stomach trouble and will have to undergo an operation in a few days just so he can live for another year <0>
so he tells the aggressive and ambituous walter to take charge of the case <0>
{} barlachs grumpy demeanor the strange circumstances of the case and the unsettling swiss countryside add a noir feel to this b w film <0>
barlachs guilt over the ridiculous wager he made as a young man lingers on with him it was a time he reflects when he does something immature he would never do at a different stage in his life <0>
{} the murdered policeman is found with a bullet through his head while he is slumped down on the seat of his car <0>
he had just left the home of gastmann as an invited guest to one of his parties where he assumed the role of a history professor in which he fooled no one at gastmanns <0>
there he was able to gain access to gastmann and meet romantically gastmanns attractive mistress anna bisset <0>
{} when snooping around gastmanns premises his south african dog attacks barlach and walter has to fire a shot killing the dog <0>
the wily barlach has things all sorted out from here on in as the story becomes a chess game with a surprise ending and much questioning about matters of guilt and innocence <0>
{} martin ritt who is usually a film director plays his part with all the right quirks and nuances to make his role quite interesting <1>
he reminded me a lot of peter falks columbo <0>
voight is a good counterbalance to ritt and to robert shaws onedimensional nazilike villain role <1>
he is able to bring an energy into the investigation something that makes the implausible situation seem a little bit more plausible <1>
but the ending when all the game plans come together left me slightly irked this easy to watch film just didnt add up <-1>
it seemed as if the story tried too hard to make sure that mans sense of justice wont be mocked anymore and i just couldnt buy into its easy solution especially when for most of the film confusion was the telling story <-1>

{} quickstop editing leaving the scene before it is fully developed both inhibit and enhance the quality of this meditative film based on a polish student in his twenties stanislaw latallo who questions life in the s while studying physics as a college student <0>
he achieves his doctorate several years later and is also diagnosed with a fatal heart condition and is by that time not overly depressed by the prospects of death as he turns more philosophical about life <0>
{} he goes through his first romance with an older woman denisiewiczolbrychska and then is rejected marries someone else malgorzata pritulak has a son watches as a close friend dies feels restless becomes financially insecure is searching for something meaningful in his life and watches as his marriage turns sour <0>
he then seeks religion but comes back to his wife and a career in science pretty much sums up the plot of this very difficult but easily recognizable quest by many students all over the world in the s <0>
the student grows up when he realizes it is almost impossible to ask for absolute answers as he says even the great eisenstein had to abandon that aim <0>
{} when he accepts full responsibility for his life and tries to become economically secure his life changes it strangely enough becomes limited as his imagination can no longer run free <0>
{} the concept of illumination whence the title of the film comes from refers to st augustines theory of enlightenment <0>
it is what fills the mind with light it is a spiritual happening that is the most powerful thing in the world <0>
{} the hero is likable somewhat courageous and scholarly a person of integrity and loyalty and is the only hope for polands future <0>
this is a glum film but intellectually sound offering many pleasurable introspective moments but lacking in real illumination which prevents it from being a great film <1>
the director a student of science himself seems to be under the impression that the person of science is the most interesting person in the world because he holds the key to knowledge <0>
that is certainly an arguable statement as even the protagonist in the story eventually realizes not everything can be settled by rational arguments <0>

[22535/b]
{} this is a mans film for the kind of a man who is lost in his sense of being a man and lost in the nostalgia of the s drug scene <0>
the women all have minor parts and are viewed as sex objects or conniving harlots <0>
its the s and were in layed back l a and theres a character called lebowski bridges who likes to be called the dude <0>
his two other bowling pals walter goodman and donny buscemi like him are dysfunctional <0>
the plot unfolds into a series of mistaken identity scenes and overthetop comedy by mistaking the dude for another lebowski a wealthy cripple the story takes on the weird humor of the coen brothers as they build a case for this likable california bum to get satisfaction over his pride being hurt <1>
he plays out a very funny fantasy role spoofing the raymond chandler private detective type of stories in the hollywood of the s <1>
{} you see the story is about intruders who piss the dude off when they piss on his rug <0>
so he goes to the rich lebowski david huddleston and asks payment for his rugs damage using the logic that it is this guys fault why it happened even if he didnt do it after all he does have the same last name and this mistake wouldnt have happened if that was not the case <0>
so you see the direction this film is going it is cartoonish in characterization with ridiculous dialogue plenty of zany characters and no discernible plot <-1>
stars make cameo appearances and do their shticks even if it adds nothing to the plot <0>
the john turturro one where he plays the flaming mexican queen is particularly funny <1>
the absurd story goes on with the big lebowski hiring the dude to be a private detective for him and get back his kidnapped wife bunny tara <0>
but since the dude is just being setup it really doesnt matter that he is not qualified for the job even if he does take this job to be a serious one and his dim observations of things are humorously abetted by his friends even dimmer observation of things which makes things really seem absurd <0>
{} the comedy here is sometimes so sharp that you could roll in the aisle with laughter and not seem any odder than the characters you see onscreen <1>
the john goodman character of the hottempered exsoldier and adage prone advisor to the dude is hysterically funny <0>
in one bit he tells one of his bowling opponents this is not nam this is bowling <0>
there are rules <0>
everything about john goodmans character will apply to his tour of duty there whether or not it is relevant to the situation <0>
{} it is not as good a film overall as fargo but it is funny enough to be a minor work in the coen brothers continuing attack on our sitcom culture <1>
it also added a nice touch by having sam eliott with his rich melodic voice garbed as a cowboy do the voiceover adding touches of inane wisdom such as his saying in mock seriousness sometimes you get the bear sometimes the bear gets you <1>
this only adds more absurdity to a story that was already bizarre to begin with <-1>

[18263/b]
{} a film about an unpopular girl heather who cant fit in with her seventhgrade classmates who wants so much to be like them and to have them love her that she is willing to do just about anything to fit in even be raped by the school bully if need be <0>
she goes by the name of dogface weiner to her cruel schoolmates who also taunt her that she is a lesbo which she stammers out is not so <0>
solondz pulls no punches pointing out the utter futility of adolescence for someone like her who cant help being a nerd and who receives no emotional support from home <0>
she in fact looks a lot like the director <0>
so we can guess that some of these horrible experiences are something that might have happened to him in puberty <0>
this loner theme is belabored and beaten into the story so much so that the obvious couldnt be made more obvious <0>
there are no subtle messages <0>
there is also no revenge of the nerd or any analytical probes into what she can do about her low selfesteem and i am most grateful for that <0>
this is simply a film that looks at why schools and families for the most part impart no concern about culture in the children they teach and raise and why they cant respond with civility and intelligence to those students who need the most help that they can get <0>
heather is so beaten down that she just wants to gain some selfesteem from her school experience any kind of encouragement would have been enormously helpful <0>
{} what sums up her situation and is her main concern can be found in this conversation with her classmate when she asks why do you hate me <0>
and the response is given so bluntly because you are so ugly <0>
her home life is also filled with angst and bitterness <0>
the parents are a cardboard caricaricture of a successful new jersey suburbanite household who dote on heathers cute younger sister leaving heather out in the cold and they respect but do not love their high school son who is a nerd but is able to function very well in school and has even gone as far as repressing his sexual drive so that he can be concerned only with getting good marks in school and thereby getting into a top college <0>
he acts more like he was an adult than a teenager even the rock band he starts is not a rebellious one but he does it because it will look good on his resume for college <0>
for heather the parents simply have no understanding or love she is reduced to either trying to be a child again by retreating to a clubhouse in her backyard or trying to foolishly hangout with an older high schooler the phoney stud who sometimes plays in her brothers band <0>
in any case whatever she does seems pathetic and even though she is very smart she does not do well in school <0>
{} since the film sinks or swims depending on how credible heather is in depicting this unhappy youngster with her vulnerabilities it is safe to say that she fitted the role perfectly <2>
the film was intense and pulsating when it zoomed in on heathers travails <2>
but lost something when it brought unnecessary action into play such as a child kidnapping and the problem of drugs being sold in school <-1>
there was no place to go in developing heathers character by adding these major societal problems to heathers story thats for another film <-1>
{} you would think that with heather being a victim of persecution that would ensure her to be kind to others who are picked on <0>
but that is not the case she shows a mean streak by striking back at them when it suits her fancy for example hurting the young kid she stays with in the clubhouse who is as lost as she is unnecessarily calling him a faggot <0>
{} solondz knows his subject well he is able to understand and convey what it is to be brought up with selfhatred and how such people can react by being sometimes just as cruel as the society they are a product of and the result is an unusual movie that focuses in on a subject very few filmmakers have chosen to do <2>
{} it was unfortunate that heather never evolved so the cruelty we observed in the beginning of the film was also the way she was observed when the film ended <0>
nevertheless an honest effort was put forth by the filmmaker to see how school age children cope with their unique problems they have <1>

{} the cruise could be described as a whirling dervish tour both of new york city and of levitchs fertile persona <0>
the guide a struggling yearold playwright living in other peoples homes to help him get by on his an hour pay scale at gray line tours he earns about a week <0>
he chose to work at this smaller tour company because his former job at the bigger apple line did not pay as much <0>
this documentary gives us a rapidfire tour of the city and his lifestyle and is both an encyclopedic look at the city and a slyly amusing look at the loquacious tour guide <1>
according to him the cruise is his philosophy of life it is about flesh respect exhibitionism it is looking at a flowers beauty and becoming the flower and the flower looking back at him he is the eccentric bob dylan lookalike named timothy speed levitch in need of approval from an audience for a job well done <0>
{} in a place like manhattan where it is easy to get lost in its few million people it is nonconformists characters like speed that make things interesting and worthwhile <0>
his tour emphasizes his lovehate relationship with the city which is now in its august love phase <0>
a tour that became legendary in the few years he worked for this company drawing an international array of tourists atop the doubledecker bus that tours manhattans million people under his breath he says he heard the other day the figure might actually be million but i dont care <0>
{} there are people who work at the world trade center he mockingly tells us as it sinks in how much humanity that is to be in such a small space <0>
he also tells us that he likes to spin around under the twin towers of the world trade center and when thoroughly disoriented to look up and reel under the illusion that the buildings are toppling down on him <0>
{} his knowledge of the literary figures and where they lived is truly spellbinding as he tells about where thomas paine died mark twain lived where the opium smoking edgar allan poe wrote the the raven how the poet dylan thomas died in the white horse tavern after having martinis and his last words were bring me another <0>
{} his view of the chrysler building quoting the critic lewis mumford that the top three floors which are an imitation of the chryslers car front grill is of an uninspired voluptuousness that central park was designed by the transcendentalist fredrick law olmstead whose vision for the park was not to play baseball or jog or roller blade or a place in which to work up a sweat but to focus on nature in a peaceful meditation <0>
{} speed confesses he took the job mainly to pick up girls <0>
work to him is one of the poisons of civilization <0>
civilization is a place that is splitting us part it encourages people to never say the truth <0>
one feels nauseous but not sick in it <0>
this is a most unusual opinion for a tour guide to have who is promoting the accomplishments of one of civilizations most advanced cities <0>
speed is more at home telling us the cruise is a way of being yourself and about how henry james lived his life here than he is about impressing the tour with the huge phallic symbol the tour bus approaches called the empire state building <0>
{} he drops the names of celebrities to point out where they reside but when he mentions greta garbo he says she chose to live in nyc because it was the only place in the world where she could be alone <0>
{} he gets a childish glee when reading from a sign he sees on one of the buildings near where he is freeloading saying everything you know is wrong <0>
for him it is these little things in life that one notices that give it its relevance <0>
what apparently irks him is that his grandparents consider him to be a failure because he doesnt have a regular type of job and is materially floundering <0>
this causes him to go off on one of his diatribes about his need for personal freedom which shows him to be a bit insecure even with all his bravado when he intellectualizes <0>
but he was confident enough of himself to quit his job and go into business for himself after this documentary he now gives his own private tours <0>
{} i loved this ecclectic tour it is shot in a clear video which is blownup to mm and looks magnificent in b w giving the film the proper atmospheric expression for its tour the documentary works so well because speeds for real as is his flowery monologue and his genuine nyc nasal accent <2>
his battle with his tour line wanting him to wear a uniform to work or else they will have to let him go is one that i side wholly with him stop trying to make people conform <1>
if you were ever interested in a tour of nyc this is a good one to catch and you dont even have to visit the city <1>

{} rivette has created a work of art from a short balzac story about art the unfinished masterpiece <0>
art and life are viewed as one and the same problem in this film about a wealthy once successful artist frenhofer piccoli as he searches for his sanity through his art who is now troubled that he can only paint a masterpiece or nothing and for the last years the later was the result except for some trivial selfportraits <0>
his wife liz birkin who modeled for his former masterpiece is concerned that something tangible has gone out of the marriage though they are still a loving couple blessed with a young daughter <0>
{} frenhofers art agent balthazar gilles brings along a young struggling artist nicolas david to visit the frenhofer mansion at languedoc <0>
he is an admirer of frenhofers work and wishes to meet him <0>
there is also the young artists attractive livein girlfriend marianne emmanuelle of the last three years someone he met when he saved her from throwing herself in front of the metro <0>
she writes childrens books but does not really consider herself a writer <0>
it is just something she does so she could be independent of nicolas <0>
{} the two artists intellectually engage in a discussion of what art means to them <0>
but when nicolas and marianne are together they try to picture themselves living in frenos mansion the place is so enormous and quiet beyond what either of them says they are currently looking for in life though he offers no comment about what he really thinks while she openly disdains the place <0>
{} after being encouraged by a visit to frenos atelier a place he hasnt been to in two months the guests view his paintings and warm up to their conversations with the host <0>
the younger artist brashly states that for him art is about taking risks it is a bold stroke something that stands out <0>
freno declares that art to him is when the forest and sea submerge as one <0>
for freno in order for the truth to come out of a work of art there must be blood on the canvas <0>
{} freno feels inspired by his guests visit he is especially taken with marianne he sees something in her besides her lovely ass and breasts and beautiful face and when balthazar suggests that he start again on his unfinished masterpiece using marianne as a model nicolas agrees for her without asking her for her permission <0>
{} la belle noiseuse which we are told is the title of the masterpiece is about a th century lady of the world who was kind of nutty in the sense that she was difficult to figure out who is referred to as being someone who is a ballbuster <0>
{} with freno back at work and the air filled with tension you might as well say let the games begin and they do <0>
but under rivettes masterly direction what happens is what you might expect to happen but not in the way you expected it to happen with the result being a fascinating look at how an artist tries to get at the essence of what he is doing struggling with all the human emotions of passion and intellectualism <2>
as those around him become in one way or another part of his work as their jealousies sexuality and life ambitions come to the surface in what transpires over the three day period he works with the nude model <0>
{} every character has a part to play in the dynamics of the artists creation as he struggles to relate with his recalcitrant she is steamed at nicolas for not consulting her saying you sold my arse and difficult model this mansion reminds her of boarding school where she was sick all the time until they eventually kicked her out of the school as he finds that he must use his wits to get her to do what he wants her to do because she is determined to be who she is that is until she becomes hypnotized under the artists careful scrutiny and finds it impossible to wear the mask in life she has previously worn <0>
the new question becomes who is she now <0>
{} what makes for a captivating depiction of an artist at work are scenes such as these where ones sense of time is lost and the length of the picture it is minutes does not seem wasted even for a minute <2>
as we watch and become part of the creation starting from scratch and actually are hearing the artists scratching sounds on the canvas for minutes at a time with no action on the screen but to view him work and watch him manipulate the model into the pose he wants even when she complains that he is hurting her <0>
{} that the truth is cruel might have seemed like bullshit to her when freno first said it but now that marianne is getting a grip on herself she is no longer scared of all the tension that is in the studio and what is going on with her relationships that is with nicolas and liz as well as with the strange attraction she has for the ish and much older artist <0>
{} the girltogirl talks with liz do not seem to do anything for her <0>
she is just curious how liz met the artist <0>
and when told they met in a cafe and that he fell for her first before painting her she seemed satisfied in knowing this but showed no concern of ever becoming a friend to liz <0>
liz on the other hand is aware of what her husband is like she knows he will behave properly with the model while working with her she realizes that his work is everything but she also knows there is a danger in these two working together that sparks could fly that he is looking for something in the models beauty that he can no longer find in her and thats what is upsetting to her as she tries to play the role of supporter of her husband by making sure marianne feels reassured to continue modeling yet guarded that something could go wrong that might upset her own relationship with freno <0>
{} marianne tells freno that she is through with nicolas even though he is the only man she can live with she must move on <0>
nicolas is consumed with jealousy admitting that it is he who needs marianne now not like the reverse situation when they first met <0>
he wants her to stop modeling and return with him to paris <0>
she not only refuses but she takes a guest room in the frenhofers leaving him alone in the inn they were staying at <0>
{} frenhofer is stuck <0>
he is filled with selfdoubt if he can ever paint again <0>
he says you get stuck in what you are searching for you get possessed by it <0>
but he explains it is fear that makes him paint for him painting becomes a tactile experience whereby his fingers are led unconsciously <0>
{} marianne asks him why me naked in front of you why not liz <0>
she goes on to say i need to understand this <0>
it seems the situation has reached a point of no return <0>
every character is now playing out his emotional trump cards <0>
the artists are struggling with what is not clear inside themselves as their wounds are opened and their vulnerabilities seem to be devastating <0>
{} liz tells her husband you are sad because you are no longer young years is a long time to stop painting and to now go on you will only destroy what happened before you start over <0>
there is a hint of a possible affair that might have taken place between balthazar and her ten years ago that seems to be the cause of the tension we feel among the three of them <0>
{} in contrast to freno nicolas cant stand the solitude he is afraid to be alone with himself <0>
when left alone he takes comfort in the company of his sister denicourt who joins him at the inn where he is staying <0>
{} liz says for freno it is the art of it it is the capturing of a whole life in a painting it is that thing that makes art shameless that is what matters to him it is as if one can see ones whole life passing in a flash like it might be for a person drowning <0>
{} while discussing their relationship nicolas states to frenhofer the only enemy of an artist is a bad painting <0>
he gets his digs in by insulting the artists lifestyle as comical <0>
so the camaraderie between the two artists seems to be genuinely plausible in the sense that they do understand each other that is as far as their work goes <0>
with freno in the position of control in his life he is able to patronizingly say to nicolas as he departs i like you dont ever change <0>
{} the last shot is with the agent talking numbers with frenhofer deciding how much they will get for the masterpiece <0>
the implication being as balthazar invites nicolas and his sister to dinner that nicolas is next in line he will profit from his art in due time <0>
{} the acting is exceptionally good by everyone <2>
piccoli as the artist is mesmerizing while emmanuelle is both beautiful and intelligent offering a special quality about her that makes it possible for us to believe that a masterpiece could come out of her poses <2>
the only thing that struck me as odd is that the final masterpiece drawn supposedly by bernard dufour did not appear to me to be a masterpiece but a rather ordinary work <-1>
the picture itself is the masterpiece that is the creative process itself was convincingly done by a director who has the skills and knowledge to tell such a story and never allow the story to be wavering from its lofty position of significance as anything but an honest intellectual effort a search for the truth within <2>

{} a b movie political thriller that was shrewd enough to get newsreel footage of the royal family and the cabinet attending the opening of parliament into its closing action scenes <0>
the juicy part of the tough cop going after the ira terrorists inspector hollis was written by richard johnson the actor who plays the hardnosed cop <0>
{} the weak script and uninspiring dialogue is compensated for by the crisp action sequences and fast pacing of the story <1>
it begins in the belfast of and a demolition expert and former britisher officer hennessy steiger tells his childhood friend and wanted ira leader sean tobin porter that he wants no part of that organization he is only interested in his family first <0>
tobin tells him that the cause of a free ireland comes above anything else to him <0>
sooner than you can say corned beef and cabbage hennessys wife and yearold daughter are accidently machined gun to death by a british soldier who stumbled when chasing after bomb and rock throwing demonstrators thereby reeling off a volley of shots that killed seven people <0>
{} hennessy is not telling anyone his plans <0>
when he takes off for london the next morning skipping his familys funeral sean decides to have his men pick him up and see what he plans on doing <0>
when forced at gunpoint into a car and unwilling to reveal his plans the gunman is suddenly overtaken by hennessy and shot <0>
the police of the special branch unit of scotland yard discover that the dead man is a thug working for the ira and commander rice trevor calls in his most fearsome agent just back from duty in belfast inspector hollis to look into the matter <0>
{} not going by the book the inspector beats it out of one of the ira cronies that it was hennessy who killed the thug the police found in the car <0>
but the cops cant figure out what is going on that is until the ira learns that hennessy is going to blow up parliament and realizing that if he does that it will be terrible for the image of the ira as the whole world will turn against them <0>
therefore they tell the police hennessys plans and say they will stop him themselves if they have to <0>
{} hennessy chooses as his london hideout the flat of his childhood friend kate brooke lee remick whose ira husband died from the blast of a bomb he planted <0>
she welcomes him into her flat but is suspicious of why he is here telling him she wants no part in violence or anything to do with the ira <0>
he says that it is better for her sake if he tells her nothing except that he has nothing to do with the ira <0>
{} the revengeful hennessy has a onetrack mind never revealing anything about his character or why he should snap in this way and come up with such a ludicrous scheme as the one he has hatched <0>
but he decides to kidnap the mp burgess moxey and disguise himself as burgess and attend the opening of the parliament with enough dynamite strapped onto him to blow it and him to smithereens <0>
{} this is one of those films that doesnt add up if you think about it <-1>
there was one scene where all hollis had to do was call rice and have the masquerading hennessy be picked up in parliament but instead he heroically and foolishly goes after hennessy by himself in parliament <0>
the film hopes to get by because of the taut acting jobs of its lead characters and by the semidocumentary glossy blackandwhite look its color tinted film has giving it a natural and gritty feel <1>
but the films ending has so many holes in its planning that the film seems incredulous and the points it make seem dull and its suspense is not that nerve wracking either since you can almost bet your house that the filmmakers are not going to have the loony hennessy blow up parliament <-2>
{} the film avoids any political manifestations making the story about the crazed loner hennessy take precedence over any sectarian issues that were in the news regarding northern ireland <0>
the best things one can say about the film was that the acting wasnt bad and it was watchable even if it was not a very believable story <1>

{} rooss first feature film as director is a snappy satirical and hip sitcom that is not a sitcom but is a semicomedy <0>
it stars ricci as a bitchy yearold without any noticeable positive qualities who begins the film by warning those who dont like her voiceovers they will be out of luck <0>
she narrates by filling in all the gaps in the story emphasizing her point of view <0>
{} ricci has run away from the louisiana mother she despises after her stepfather dies and she chooses to live with her halfbrother donovan who is gay and lives with his lover ivan <0>
donovans true love has died of aids and he has inherited his lovers wealthy home <0>
ricci proceeds to steal ivan from donovan by seducing him and telling him that she is pregnant with his child <0>
ivan even states that he is now a bisexual not a homosexual <0>
she runs away with ivan and steals dollars from donovan plus the ashes from his deceased lover <0>
{} lisa is the embittered acid tongued single sister of donovans dead lover <0>
she works as a teacher in the same school as donovan <0>
in fact she has a crush on him but to her dismay she introduced him to her brother <0>
{} lovette is the lowkey sheriff who woos lucia <0>
galecki is the comically bodypierced gay former student at the high school donovan teaches at who falsely accuses him of making sexual advances <0>
but he really pines for ivan <0>
lee is the crazed christian fundamentalist who was born with one testicle and is riccis lover and the real father of the child <0>
{} this film tells you how smart it thinks it is that it is so cleverly written that it can say anything about anyone and get away with it <-2>
what remained constantly grating throughout the film was riccis snide voiceover comments that were politically incorrect insulting gays and holding a negative view of sex <-2>
she dresses in tartish campy outfits and is always smoking a cigarette adding to the films theme of being opposite to what is expected of a teen <-1>
ricci succeeds in her role of getting the audience to dislike her <-1>
but when you contrast the personalities of the men compared to the women the men leads are bland and affable while the women all have verve and fuller depth to their characters <1>
{} how one rates this film depends on what one is looking for <0>
if it is laughs one is after there are plenty of them <1>
if it is a welldeveloped film not a one gag movie then one might be disappointed in the film as it tended to make one grow weary of its plot and put off by its overly clever voiceover <-1>
if it is acting one is looking for then one can appreciate lisas role as she finds it within herself to convey in an honest way how an intelligent but frightened and lonely woman behaves <1>
if one is looking for some deep meaning then one will be pleased by lovetts reflective statement to lisa that sex isnt just for recreation or procreation but for concentration that when making love the experience allows one to relate wholly with someone else so that one can forget their loneliness <1>
lovett goes on to say if his lover walks into a crowded room he is the one he wants her to notice <1>
{} for me the film was a mixed bag of emotions <0>
since i am not partial to sitcom style movies no matter how conventional or unconvential they may seem to be i found myself swaying back and forth liking some parts of the film and resenting other parts and just like everything about the film i was ultimately left in a paradoxical mood <0>

the local constable gibbons mackenzie is very hostile to the air force people investigating these crimes he even has a fist fight with the major when he sees him over at barbaras house i think hes a little jealous and refuses to cooperate in anyway <0>
but the major finds out from the local doctor bradley madden and the military doctor winfield that all the victims had their brains sucked out of them as well as their spinal cords removed <0>
{} the major also learns that barbara is doing secretarial work for a reclusive research professor walgate kynaston reeves and he notices in her possession a manuscript for a book on thought control which sparks his interest thinking there might be a connection there to the recent murders <0>
his interest is further increased by his meeting with the strange but amiable professor as a fourth murder is committed <0>
this time it is the mayor who gets his brains sucked out and spinal cord removed <0>
and if that wasnt enough constable gibbons on a search party in the woods for the killer disappears and shows up later in state of shock as he dies in the same manner as the others who were killed <0>
{} by this time the major and barbara show a strong affection for each other and a little romance is blooming without even a kiss or holding of hands taking place though there is one scene where she comes out of the shower with just a towel on and you know that got the majors attention <0>
now this romance could be taken for a serious one <0>
but the major is a busy man so romance must take second place in this film <0>
it seems that the major is the only one on the base who does any work <0>
the security officer captain chester kilburn hes more into doing paperwork than fieldwork and the colonel butler maxted who is good at delegating all responsibility to the major and is therefore left with a clear mind to make the big decisions like ordering the major to get the killer before the locals really get mad and try to shut down the base <0>
so you see the major is a very busy man <0>
{} the major begins his investigation for real by speaking to the professor without holding back that the he is under suspicion <0>
he believes that the professor is involved with the murders especially when he learns from his security officer that the f b i has a file on the professor doing psychic research with atomic power and one of the books he published is on cybernetics <0>
{} lucky for the major he borrowed barbaras searchlight before going to the local cemetery because when he sees someone fleeing the mayors airtight mausoleum he enters it and gets locked in there and if werent for barbara knowing where to find him the major would have perished that night <0>
{} it now becomes obvious that the professor is involved in this mystery and the fun part of the film begins or some might think the film really goes out of whack from here on <0>
the prof comes clean and goes into detail how he created these invisible mutant creatures by tapping into the bases atomic power source and putting an electrical charge to his brain <0>
he now urges the air force to destroy the nuclear plant or else the invisible creatures cant be stopped <0>
but things are not that simple the atomic plant malfunctions and cant be shut down and to my delight the creatures become visible because of the increase in atomic power in the nuclear plant <0>
{} whats viewed on screen are brains with a spinal cord attacking everybody they see killing all the people manning the nuclear plant <0>
the colonel is tremendous in the crisis he keeps popping these hopping brains with his pistol and it turns out they are mortal turning to mush when shot <0>
there are great special effects using stopmotion animation to show the brains moving around <1>
meanwhile the colonel realizing the tight situation they are in tells the major to singlehandedly go into the nuclear plant and dynamite it <0>
the major leaves before barbara could talk him out of it <0>
as some comfort the security officer tells her dont worry if anyone could succeed in this impossible situation its jeff <0>
luckily the genius professor runs out to act as a diversion for the hopping brains and gets devoured by three of them giving jeff a chance to complete his mission <0>
{} as entertainment value this film should hit the right spot its a screamer <2>
as anything greater the story made little sense <-1>
this is just another mutant b flick that is missing most of its brain <0>
if the invisible creatures were supposed to bring with them an antiatomic war message the message was garbled and got lost somewhere along the way along with mans free will to resist the invisible creatures who represent the forces in man that bring about war <0>

{} in a northern french village bailleul in the region of flanders the roar of a motorbike is heard coming down the deserted towns empty streets <0>
this is the first film by bruno dumont as it takes us to a town that is so cheerless we will never want to put it on our tourist agenda when visiting the beautiful flemish countryside <0>
dumont a former teacher uses mostly nonprofessional actors and the problem he has with that is that the story is so unnerving and there is no one around who could add pizzazz to it to give us a reason for enjoying it <-2>
as we meet the yearold inarticulate skinhead looking fred douche who obediantly kisses his mom the proprietor of a small cafe as he gets off his bike and enters her cafe and we watch him go to his room and have sex with his pretty blond girlfriend marie marjorie who works as a cashier in a grocery store and lives for these sexual encounters but shows no real enjoyment over them and even complains to him that he hurt her once <0>
{} appearances dont lie the town is boring and fred is an unhappy man with fiery glazed eyes and a sullen stare to go along with the epileptic seizures he often gets which seem to come upon him when things are not going right for him <0>
{} the first problem i have with this film is why this title since there is not one single thing about this film that pertains to the myth of jesus <-1>
i understand the title comes curiously enough from a philologist ernest renan whose idea of christianity was the basis of the script <0>
but this inarticulate film failed to convey any religious feeling and therefore it made no sense to keep that misleading title <-2>
the life of fred would have been a more appropriate and less insulting title <0>
{} dumont shot this film almost like a straight documentary using lots of closeups on the youngsters with long stretches of nothing much happening on the screen cinema verite style except the annoying sound of motorbikes racing through town <-1>
as it traces the life and lives of a troubled bunch of youngsters with nothing to do but ride their bikes play chicken with passing cars hurl racist slurs and pay no heed to what is happening in the world as they cannot fit into society and are angry at their state of being <0>
though it should be pointed these are not criminal kids just the regular garden variety of locals <0>
{} it is a film where nothing happens but boredom is rampant where a sentence of dialogue makes us pick up our ears as if something is being said that must be heard and we dont want to miss it <-2>
but we soon learn that nothing that is said is meaningful <-2>
these youngsters are not likable or approachable even watching them on film is chilling as they are so unmoving that it is easy for the mind to wander and think what a waste of time this is whats the point one can get gloomy just by watching these misfits hang around doing nothing <-2>
{} what saddens this group is the death by aids of one of their members brother which shakes them up seeing someone in this smalltown die <0>
fred arranges a day at the beach to console the grieving brother <0>
{} this group of yearolds on welfare and on a deadend mission in life has tuned out of expecting anything good to happen to them <0>
the only one getting a bit of a bang out of life is freddy who says he loves marie and cant get enough of her <0>
{} into the picture enters a handsome arab kader kader who is insulted by the groups racial slurs directed at him and his family as he responds with his own brand of stupidity and macho behavior by aggressively showing a sexual interest in marie <0>
this gives the group an outlet for their restlessness and violent tendencies <0>
it also underscores the racial tensions in society where bigotry is an accepted fact of life <0>
{} but the group first must embarrass their families by a gang molestation of an obese drum majorette in their marching band who is cruelly hurt by this attack telling her farmer father about it who makes arrangements with the boys families to pay him for the damage or he will go the police <0>
{} fred messes up the one seemingly good thing in his life and loses his girlfriend over that incident <0>
as a result the racial slurs grow into violence as marie takes an interest in the arab and the hatred and the disappointments in freds life get out of control and the bitterness that has slowly builtup sinks firmly into his skin as it culminates in the attack on the arab who in all fairness acted very stupidly himself bringing on an unneeded escalation of the conflict by his own display of testiness <0>
{} in the end there is just a feeling of impotence here that there is a major problem out there in society and there does not seem to be one single answer to solve it <0>
in some respects these kids reminded me of the littleton colorado kids who spouted neonazi slogans and massacred a number of high school students as their rage built and no one could really see what was happening <0>
{} this is the kind of film you might see once and you get all that you possibly can from it as it is hauntingly told but there is no point in seeing it again <-1>
it is such an ugly story and since it would have been more suited to be a documentary than a feature movie as it offered no drama or enjoyment in the viewing of it <-2>
it was more fit to be a primer for the ills of society put under the microscope and how aimless a young man can be and uncommunicative that he so easily loses the one person who could have held him in check <-1>
{} if this film was trying to be told from a christian perspective that what these kids needed was religion and moral values then it certainly did not make its case <-2>
there are just no answers here for what happened that can make sense <-2>

{} home from the chechen war where he was a h q clerk danila sergei bodrov is now aimless and unemployed <0>
his mother tells him to leave this small village and go to st petersburg formerly leningrad and see his older brother viktor soukhoroukov he is the only hope for you <0>
he will help you get work <0>
{} in st petersburg he finds that viktor works for the russian mob and is in trouble with a chechen mobster who has control of the black market operations in town <0>
viktor gets danila to do some of the dirty gun work he cant do himself against his stronger opposition <0>
this is all played out against the background of a russia falling apart as a world power its cultural roots are in decay as its youth is turning to drugs and a decadent western style of rock music and its cities are becoming safe havens for gangsters to act with impunity causing a breakdown in law and order <0>
{} danila is fiercely proud to be russian antiintellectual and a newly converted fan of the russian rock group nautilus who have a hit cd wings he has a hard time finding in any store <0>
it was easier for him to be pulling off his first job against the chechen mobster than buying a nautilus cd <0>
on that assignment he ends up killing one of the chechens henchman and in his escape he is slightly wounded as he hops onto a tram and gets help from the driver svetlana svetlana <0>
her husband is in jail which gives him the opportunity to have sex with her <0>
in his forceful and blunt way hiding his violent tendencies with the warmest smile in st petersburg he professes to have a real romantic interest in her sincerely sympathizing with her that men are often beating her up <0>
she seems to so passively accept her beatings as part of her life which i guess is symbolic of how russia treats its women <0>
{} everything that we learn about the new russian attitudes comes from seeing it through danilas naive eyes <0>
he is someone searching for a morality that seems to have evaporated from the old russian cities <0>
when he befriends a german peddler by protecting him from mobsters who are trying to shake him down he does so because he feels it is the right thing to do <0>
he expresses gratitude that the peddler is not a jew but a german because he doesnt like jews but he doesnt have anything against germans <0>
the german turns out to be a man who doesnt know anymore what is happening to society but he likes to live by this saying what is good for the russian is death for the german <0>
at a later point in the story he tells the country boy that the cities are dark forces the strong come here but they get weak the city takes over their strength <0>
this scene for one thing tells how xenophobic the russians have always been and still are <0>
{} danilas entry into the drug and rock scene comes about when he is attracted to a young druggie hipster the pert blond kat joukova who gets him to spend money on drugs so that they can party together <0>
meanwhile he continues working for his weakkneed brother by helping him knock off a few of the chechen mobsters <0>
the brother is startled at how good danila is with a gun something he probably learned during the war even though danila is evasive about what he did during his army tenure <0>
{} danila doesnt complain that he is doing all the dirty work he now has plenty of money for the girls and enough money to buy himself clothes and to get the cds he loves listening to and talking about <0>
his mindlessness and quiet charm and the heroic qualities he often displays are both chilling and pitiful to observe <0>
all his accomplishments seem to come through the force of a gun <0>
{} if anything this slickly done gangster thriller should be taken as a political warning by the west that russia is a wounded animal and still dangerous and a wounded animal is frightened and will often do anything to lash out at those it perceives as hurting it <0>
there were many diverting scenes that make that point crystal clear <0>
in a drugged and alcoholic stupor at a party with kat he lashes out verbally at a musician he thinks is american <0>
when told that he is french he replies same insults go for him <0>
{} in another scene that shows his hatred for things that are american he is in macdonalds and refuses to eat the american food but kat who is heavily into the western scene is seen gleefully gulping down a hot apple pie <0>
{} what should make danilas character frightening to the west is that his prejudices and violent acts are readily accepted by the moviegoing russian public as the proper way to act <0>
{} when viktor betrays danila to the chechan mobsters who invade viktors apartment to set a trap for the brother he outfoxes them and succeeds in killing off his brothers enemies sparing the life of his cowardly brother <0>
he then reverses the mocking remarks his mother told him when he first came home from the army as he now mockingly tells the sniveling viktor to hitchhike back to mamma and take care of her with the money he just gave him she is an old lady and needs you <0>
it seems there is a special place in his heart for the russian even if he is a betrayer after all he is a russian brother <0>
{} danila backtracks to his girlfriends <0>
but they dont love him or even want to know him <0>
so he leaves one a musical tape and the other a little money he collected from his criminal efforts and he grabs a ride from a truck driver who is heading to moscow <0>
that should be another stop where his resume as a gangster will come in handy for the future <0>
he is just as dangerous and aimless and charming as when he left the army <0>
{} sergei bodrov is devastating as the symbol of the old russian coming back as the new russian <0>
his performance gives the film a reverberating force depicting the chaos currently going on in a deteriorating country and how difficult it would be to reach someone like him when he can be so deceptive by just smiling and so distant by tuning out what he doesnt want to hear <0>
it is in his soul that rests the centuries of russias life of misery and war whose struggle is never over but always seems to be just beginning <0>
he has infused the film with a raw power that touches the nerves of the things that westerners understand the least about the russians <1>
all this makes for a fascinating film one that is popular in russia and is quite different from the usual russian films exported to america <2>
it is one of the most insightful films i have seen about modern russia and how organized crime has taken a foothold in the country <2>
it is a film that has its finger on the problems the severe economic decay in russia and the rise of criminals to fill the void of a lost morality has caused <0>
russia is now a country where even a brother might be taken for a stranger except for our gangster hero who is trying to make some sense of what he sees going on since the collapse of communism whose simple forceful ways to back up the wrongs he sees seem very attractive to a desperate and cynical people who yearn for a hero to save them from all the corruption <0>
this film has the look and tone of those old american b movies but with a little more depth in its political aims and much more pessimism for its countrysfuture <1>

[18032/b]
{} an exciting and entertaining actioner that tests the plausibility of its story with an unreality check yet is real on its emotional levels testing the heroines reactions to love guilt loss of identity and a deprived upbringing which is rare for this genre to be so concerned with actual human values <2>
anne the wife of luc plays nikita with a flair exhibiting the tremendous energy and orneriness needed to make the part exceptional <2>
the film plays like an mtv special using a splash of coloring to light up the screen and very fast paced action sequences to keep you mindlessly glued to the screen <1>
but that is disarming since this film has more than that to offer even if it does not seem so during certain stretches of the film <1>
it is worth sticking with this film it gets better and less predictable the more you get into it <1>
though its ending does leave a lot to be desired <-1>
{} nikita is a violent junkie who gets caught in a bloody robbery gets a life sentence and is turned over to the government so she could train to be an agent for them doing the dirty work they have to do for them such as assassinations <0>
this part of the story lags as we watch how this violent misfit channels her antisocial aggressiveness into acceptibility for her new role in life one that society supposedly can appreciate <0>
her teacher is bob tcheky who falls for her but plays it on the upandup remaining dedicated to the government he works for never questioning their ruthless and unethical tactics <0>
as we can easily surmise she proves herself fit for her assignment and the big event will climax on how she will fare on her first job <0>
{} jeanne moreau has a nice little cameo in nikitas schooling scenes teaching the yearold how to be a woman <0>
there is one great scene where we see the young nikita putting on makeup next to moreau and we are dazzled by looking at the faces of the two stars fillup the screen with moreau wrinkles and all still looking quite sexy and alluring and in my way of looking at things the one who is the more alluring <2>
{} with nikitas graduation from school she is now a secret agent who will answer to the code name josephine as she is given money to set up an apartment and life of her own since the government has done a mock funeral for her and she has no relations who will ask questions about her she is now completely reborn as a new person <0>
she quickly meets a checker in a supermarket mario anglade and they fall in love and move in together <0>
she remains mute to him about her biography demanding that he asks her no questions as she continues to go on hit man assignments for the government in a seemingly neverending redemption for her past crimes <0>
{} her final assignment goes awry as a cleaner victor reno is called in to mop up after the important mission of going into an ambassadors safe to steal documents that will link some private companies to some shady dealings is about to be aborted <0>
victor is menacing brutal and maniacal and this outcome of mayhem convinces nikita that it is time for her to move on <0>
{} so we have come full cycle and nikita has developed an appreciation for life that she never had before leaving us with much moral fodder to chew on more than most actioners leave us with and we come to the understanding that this incredible story that is hardly plausible that is seemingly cartoonish is much better than it appears on surface because somehow or other it satisfies our need to know something about covert operations and the people who go into it on a nonvoluntary basis plus the movie is very entertaining and was able to hold our attention even through the rough spots in it <2>

[22522/a]
{} a film that tries to bring back the fantasies and dreams of childhood for two young women in their twenties <0>
it is an incomprehensible enjoyable uninhibited slapstick romp <0>
as insignificant as the title of the film is to the story i am at least sure that celine and julie are seen at one moment towards the end of the film going boating at least i think i saw them <0>
{} celine is played by juliet berto she is a nightclub magician and julie the shy librarian is played by dominque labourier <0>
this film is very loosely based on henry james a romance of certain old clothes <0>
{} the plot is basically about julie allowing celine to share her flat and the two of them acting in an impromptu manner they wrote their own dialogue as we see them sharing a boyfriend and partaking in their daily routines <0>
but there are unusual complications to this already complicated story and in the subplot there are two actresses playing the same part bertoogier and dominquepiser <0>
the four of them each take turns to visit every day a haunted house and watch the same events take place <0>
what results is an hallucinatory fable that is funny scary idiosyncratic original lesbiancentered derivative of cartoons and musicals and truly indescribable <0>
it is a true cinephiles delight and a challenge to the old linear way of looking at films <1>
it is a film that should be seen more than once since it requires proper mood and spirit to enter its delightful summertime montmartre locale and the visions of its meditations and it takes some getting used to since this is a different type of cinema from the usual american fare <1>
{} this is a special movie that some might detest or feel put upon on first viewing it but is for others an exhilarating work an outstanding example of a noncommercial film allowed to take on the personalities of the stars without worry about it being a formula story or needing a glib ending <2>
it is deserving of its wonderful reputation among cinephiles <2>
{} as my mother used to say when she gave me something to eat as a child that i wasnt familiar with and i made a face try it who knows you might like it <1>

[19878/c]
{} a student of forensic medicine the son of a deceased french diplomat mathias barillet emmanuel salinger coming with his youthful diplomat friend jeanjacques thibault by train from germany to paris is stopped at the border and searched by the border guards and grilled by a mysterious man who expresses a meanspirited resentment against him <0>
when he returns to his paris hotel he finds a severed head in his suitcase <0>
why he doesnt turn the head over to the police the most logical thing in the world to do is never fully explained to my satisfaction <-1>
but this espionage thriller picking up on the theme of the cold war will be about his searching for the identity of the head and its possible connection to the man who harshly interrogated him on the train <0>
{} he visits his sister marie marianne denicourt who is rehearsing classical songs for her upcoming opera recital and possible trip to russia <0>
the opera company is run by jeanjacques boss varins jeanluc boutte a seemingly controlling figure choosing to remain in the background <0>
here mathias will be introduced into the drab world of the underlings who keep the spy system going something his father did but what he chooses not to do <0>
needing a place to live he teams up with another diplomat he is introduced to at the rehearsal a more forceful type than he is william bruno and they rent a large apartment which is strictly divided in half like the berlin wall with no encroachment allowed without special permission <0>
{} there is also an attempt at romance with the head pathologists elusive daughter claude devos where the opposites try and mesh at least he representing the very sober field of science wants a relationship with the carefree art student who prefers a different type of guy to his chagrin <0>
{} meanwhile in slowtime it becomes apparent that there is some kind of political corruption going on by the diplomats he knows in paris and by his interrogator who is now identified as a doubleagent by the name of bleicher jeanlouis richard <0>
he is someone upset with the governments appeasement of the communists <0>
all this spy business was rather vaguely done and gave no particular credence to the story except it did show a large vacuousness among the young as to their countrys recent history <-1>
what the film couldnt do was make all this interesting and tangible to the story it was telling <-1>
a story which threw out many possible situations but never delved fully into them <-1>
so what remains is a naive medical student with friends and a sister he has alienated and a mystery story that has no great payoff for the hours it took to tell it <-1>
yet it was somewhat diverting as a study of the students and their attitudes <1>
the russian scientists severed head is used as a symbol for the cold war and is dissected by the medical student and shown to be part of the cloakanddagger game played by both sides which still goes on because enemies are needed to assert the righteousness of one side over the other <0>
{} the naive hero is not convincing enough in his role as a seeker of justice and the film as a political thriller suffers from a lack of focused direction <-1>
what is absorbing is the psychological mood of the students shown and how they view their place in a possibly united europe <1>
it was a good idea for a film that tried to show that metaphorically opposites might attract but cant stay together but it was too poorly executed for one to sustain an interest in its long drawn out meandering story <-1>

[20046/b-]
{} the american dream is a ragstoriches story <0>
when ones inventive ability is in a technical field like telephone repairs the occupation the industrious mal granger obrien works at and if the loose living mal gets there by dishonest means which he does then it makes his rise to power a mockery <0>
this is not the way the american dream is meant to be earned <0>
it can only be attained by the honest means of hard work and fair play and through ones ability <0>
at the time this film was being made there were national newspaper stories running about the dangers of bookmaking and this film was made as an answer to that expose <0>
as a noir story shot handsomely in bw this film conveys mals rise to power in the world of california bookies and his inevitable downfall caused by greed and bad judgment <0>
{} after losing to his bookie chippie sammy at the horses chippie introduces him to the big wheel behind the operation vince walters kelley thinking that they can help each other out <0>
mal uses his technical skills from being a telephone repairman to rig the phone wiring all the bookies in california with racing results as soon as they are announced at the track <0>
when mal feels he is being played for a sucker by his boss who is getting very rich from his savvy in electronics but paying him only a weekly instead of cutting him in for a share of the illegal profits mal is ready to doublecross him by rerigging the phones thereby forcing himself in as a partner <0>
the more successful he becomes the less scruples he has about being a fulltime criminal <0>
when the operation cracks down on the local bookies mal ignores their plight and sides with the cruel boss <0>
a disgruntled bookie in a state of panic at being forced out of business by the syndicate comes into the office and kills vince <0>
taking advantage of the situation mal now heads the syndicate <0>
{} there is a slight romantic interest shown for the nice girl dorothy who worked for vince and who now works for mal <0>
but he spurns her in favor of the hot love he has for gail dru who happens to be married to one of the big bosses in the bookie field larry mason donald porter <0>
he represents the big syndicates eastern boss the coy carl stephens otto kruger <0>
{} lt pete wright howard st john of the incorruptible gangster squad cracks down on the bookie operations across the state <0>
mal is forced into joining the eastern syndicate for protection but he soon realizes they are gypping him of his share and he also grows increasingly jealous of larry who is not only married to the woman he loves but is now his boss in the syndicate <0>
so he hires a treacherous gunman osterloh to execute him <0>
this results in his taking over larrys position in the mob <0>
{} when the hitman tries to muscle his way into mals organization saying he wont keep quiet if he isnt payed off with a partnership mal runs him over <0>
but in his panic as the police question him he uses the alibi that he was vacationing in palm springs rigging the phone to make it appear as if he was there <0>
this comes back to haunt him as his call is recorded and on it there is a trolley car whistle which can only be heard in the city <0>
{} the change in mal is now complete caught up in greed and power and lust he is being tracked by both the police and the mob <0>
he escapes to las vegas to rip off the mob for one last time in a phone rigging gambling scheme then gets trapped in the crossing of hoover dam as he tries to exit nevada for his last chance of hope in arizona with the police closing in on him <0>
{} the big boss otto kruger walks away from all this clean as a whistle as he goes back to his home in ohio seemingly still in charge of things <0>
this moralistic tale spins an interesting take on the criminal genius who falls and the sychophant crime bosses who cant be stopped completely <1>
in even with many states operating legal horse betting parlors the bookie business is bigger than ever <0>
there is something sinister to be said about the smiling otto kruger that leaves a dark shadow on the ground as he heads back to his wealthy home a part of the american dream that is turned into a nightmare <0>
kruger also has the best line in the film when he tells chippy i admire loyalty but not to the wrong people <1>

[17971/c]
{} this version of the pied piper is not exactly told as a childrens fable retelling the robert browning poem of the piper donovan who rids hamelin of its rats as this english speaking film placed in the able hands of the french director jacques demy reveals a gripping story of evil in the middleages a time when million people across europe died of the plague <1>
as he tells of the corrupted church and local town administrators working in cahoots as their maniacal plans coincide to support a papal war in italy and for the town to build a huge cathedral for itself all this in the midst of the bubonic plague of which the church interpreted as part of gods master plan <0>
{} we are in northern germany and a caravan of gypsy performers led by mattio keith stops to pick up a musician donovan as they try to reach hamelin for the wedding celebration between the lordly franz hurt and lisa cathyrn the wealthy burgermeisters fourteen year old daughter but are refused entry to the city because of fear that they might be carriers of the plague <0>
in the hamlet lisa is in a coma <0>
a delegation of clergy is there to give her the last rites but the burgermeister summons as a last resort the aid of the towns outcast the jewish alchemist melius hordern who states the girl is not going to die she doesnt have the plague but needs rest and music <0>
the church delegates leave in a huff accusing the jew of causing the plague and dabbling in work that goes against gods will <0>
soon a pipers soothing music coming from outside the gates of the hamlet is heard as it revives the young girl encouraging the burgermeister to summon the piper who tells the messengers sent to retrieve him that he will not enter unless his gypsy friends can also enter the hamlet <0>
{} gavin wild is the crippled helper of melius idolizing him looking to him for paternal advise and wisdom <0>
he is in love with lisa who is a few years younger than he is but is helpless to stop the marriage of the very evil selfserving franz who appears to be a man in his s who does not love lisa but insists on the marriage as a means of getting a dowry from her family money that his family dearly needs <0>
lisa is just a little girl who doesnt seem capable of loving anyone at this point of her life <0>
{} the baron is evilly played by donald pleasence who has taxed his subjects to the limit and now must devise ways to get more money for his fiefdom <0>
franz devises a plan for the pope to have his soldiers for war by forcing the alchemist to come up with gilded gold which the baron will use to give to the hamlets teenagers so that they will be enticed into joining the popes army in italy while their fathers stay home to build the barons cathedral <0>
thereby the pope having gotten the soldiers from town will supply the rest of the money needed to finish the cathedral <0>
{} at the wedding celebration the rats are present everywhere scaring the town to death <0>
the piper offers to get rid of the rats if the burgermeister gives him guildas <0>
when the piper plays his tune and the rats all march out of the town and are drowned in the river the burgermeister foolishly and greedily thinking that the crisis from the rats causing the black plague is over reneges on his promise to the piper <0>
as a result the piper plays his tune and all the children including lisa leave with the piper disappearing with him to wherever he is leading them to <0>
the only one who cant make it is the crippled gavin who leaves town with the gypsyies since his mentor was burnt at the stake by the church inquisitors <0>
{} this version of brownings poem is welltold and sensible and probably a lot like he meant it to be conveyed <1>
but somehow it looks flat on screen like it was a b movie and this is surprising since demy is really a great director <-1>
but evidently something went terribly wrong here <-2>
the film is so flatly done it was as if i was watching the machinelike actors go through the motions of acting out a chilling story that when it came out on screen had lost its chills even if the story itself remained chilling <-2>

a porter throws some luggage in the back of a san francisco cab and the cabbie panics upon seeing a cop and runs him over but not before the cop fires a shot killing him <0>
the investigating officers lieutenant guthrie warner andersonhe was in the tv series and inspector quine emile meyer question a mr dressler bailey who is a manager with the san francisco opera house after they find in his luggage a figurine with a quarter of a kilo of heroin in it <0>
they ascertain after initially being suspicious of him that he is an innocent victim of a drug smuggling operation that uses tourists unwittingly by placing the drugs in their luggage and then stealing back the contents after they clear customs <0>
the same porter who threw the luggage in the cab is soon found by the police in the water apparently dying from a hot shot an overdose of heroin <0>
this comes about after there is an actual lineup in the film as all the ships porters are brought in so that dressler could identify the one who threw his luggage in the cab <0>
but since the rather snooty dressler was not observant of these lowerclass types he was unable to pick the porter out of the lineup <0>
{} into the picture enters dancer and julian on a flight from miami to san francisco casually discussing the use of the subjunctive tense as the older mentor tells him to use the term if i were you instead of i was you it sounds better and he then rhetorically comments how many characters who hang out on street corners can say if i were you <0>
julian is trying his best to upgrade the volatile dancer into becoming a firstclass hood rather than just being a runofthe mill psychopath <0>
one of the other peculiarities that julian has is that he likes to know from dancer the last words his victims say just before he shoots them <0>
these two psychopaths are real beauties and give the film the kind of quirkiness that keeps its brutal scenes counterbalanced with a nice edge of verbal nastiness <0>
landing in s f their wheel man sandy mclain meets them with his soupedup rental car rented with a stolen credit card by their motel and the dialogue among the three is a real treat for fans of this genre <0>
sandy asks them how does it feel to earn for one day of work and julian responds dancer derives no particular pleasure from the money <0>
as sandy keeps yapping away and drinking whiskey from a bottle julian empties the bottle and tells him we prefer as little conversation from outsiders as possible dancer works better that way <0>
{} their work will be to retrieve three separate shipments of heroin smuggled into s f from hong kong by three different voyagers on the boat and get it to the man by fourthirty p m <0>
the boss is not known by the hired thugs who are curious about him and question the driver about him without getting any results <0>
{} the first shipment is willingly brought in by a merchant seaman warner who is not supposed to know what he is bringing in but finds out and tries to extort more money from dancer than his agreed upon payment <0>
before dancer kills him in the steamroom of the merchants seamans hotel he corrects the seamans english when he says i dont like it when i cant see who i am talking to <0>
he emphatically says it is whom <0>
warners last words duly noted for julians benefit are why be greedy <0>
this comes after asking for only a thousand dollars for his silence <0>
the second shipment came by way of an unsuspecting couple in their silverware <0>
when dancer comes to their home and they are unavailable he tells the servant tang that there was a mixup of luggage on the boat and requests to switch luggage but the servant becomes suspicious of him and refuses to give him the silverware case which turns out to be a mistake as the maniacal dancer kills him without blinking an eye as he is running up the stairs to tell his employer <0>
his last words are mr sanders <0>
the final shipment was brought in by a mother and a daughter as the heroin is concealed inside the girls japanese doll <0>
they meet the two in an aquarium and dancer tries his charm out on the mother who is disapponted that the girls father did not meet them when the boat arrived dancer tells her no one likes to travel alone and they go back to the hotel together but things go wrong when they find that the heroin packet is not inside the doll <0>
the girl found the powder and thought it was makeup so she powdered the dolls face <0>
instead of killing them julian talks dancer into taking them back to the man to explain what happened to the drugs this way they wont have to worry if the man thinks they ran off with his heroin and has to put out a hit on them <0>
{} they arrive at an arcade called sutros museum but they dont realize that an alert mounted horse policeman spotted their license plate and the police trail them here <0>
dancer goes to give the man the heroin shipments but when he talks to him trying to explain what happened the man tells him that hes dead nobody sees my face and lives <0>
well dancer takes one more humiliation from him a slap in the kisser then he pushes the wheel chaired boss to his death down onto an ice skating rink <0>
the man turns out to be a cruel reminder of the fatherfigure symbol which is supposed to explain why dancer is so driven with hate <0>
earlier in the film julian tells how dancer is addicted with hate because his father abandoned him <0>
{} the climax comes by way of a high speed chase that ends when the wheel man goes down the wrong highway and gets stuck where the highway is under construction <0>
when turning around to get back on the freeway dancer kills the wheel man for his mistake and when julian starts blaming him for getting them in this mess and goes to surrender to the police dancer plugs his pal in the back but not before he says how about some last words for the book <0>
he then takes the girl hostage but she frees herself from him and the police shoot dancer and the girl and her mother are found to be safe as the film ends just like it does as if it were done on its own popular tv series with everything tidied up <0>
{} this film is not noteworthy for its sadistic story but what makes it rise above the ordinary b movie is the strangely provocative dialogue and the utter depravity of all the criminals who are shown in all their ugliness and unredeeming features <1>
it also makes good use of locales such as the aquarium and ice skating rink and halffinished highway and it adds a feeling of desperation by using props such as the japanese doll which is ravished by the psychopaths after they get by for a short time having a normal conversation but must revert back to their violent impulses when they cant get what they want <1>
but what turns out to be their downfall is precipitated by the onetime they are unprofessional and want to see who their boss is <-1>
the outcome shows that they cant rise to another social level despite all their efforts to polish dancers image <0>

{} michael polishs feature debut as director twin falls idaho tells the story of conjoined twins blake mark polish and francis falls michael polish whose lugubrious lives are a result of their inexplicable birth and unique appearance <0>
their situation has made them bonded by the hip and forced to exist together with the stronger blake keeping the dying francis alive by having his heart do most of the work for both <0>
they chose not to get surgery saying that they came into this world together and will leave together <0>
having come to an unnamed idaho city from their circus home in search of their mother lesley ann warren who abandoned them at birth wanting to see her before they die realizing that francis is fading fast <0>
as a birthday gift for their th year blake calls a prostitute for francis who comes up to their fleabag hotel room and after initially being repulsed by them as freaks running away from them returns to get to know them and help the sick francis by getting her doctorfriend patrick bauchau as miles to treat him <0>
{} the film is packed with tension emanating from the choreographed looks given off from the brothers that is filled with their history of fear and insulation from the world around them <0>
it is through the eyes of penny michele hicks a former model the prostitute who remains with them because she wants to get some good karma after viewing her life as a failure that we begin to know the boys <0>
penny like the audience gets used to these freaks and begins to see them as very gentle and touching human beings and her heart not her sex goes out to them <0>
she falls for the more articulate blake which causes some jealousy for his brother being that this is the first time that the brothers cant share the same experience <0>
at this point the story could have gone in a number of directions there were just so many themes it touched on but chooses not to sensationalize its tale instead it becomes a very sobering tearjerker <1>
though there were some moments for levity as when blake tells penny maybe ill see you when im single <0>
the film nevertheless remains too sober for its own good <-1>
{} for the siamese twins what becomes important is not their first taste of sex but of an intimacy shared with an attractive woman <0>
their physical and emotional constraints become the storyline and the two minutes of loneliness experienced every day when blake goes to sleep and when he wakes up is something blake can wonder about giving him a sense of individuality <0>
at a halloween party that penny takes them to which she says is their one day to be seen in public as normal it is their one day to not be looked upon as freaks becomes for them their acid test with the real world <0>
but all they see at this party are people who are less normal than they are <0>
the symbolism comes on a bit too heavy as we see a couple dressed as siamese twins just untie the strings that connect their costumes which is something that the brothers are unable to bring themselves to do realizing it would be the death of francis and anyway blake would only have a fiftyfifty chance of surviving plus he is afraid of living alone <0>
for the brothers they just prefer to be left to themselves and let their fate be as written though blakes heart beats faster than his brothers demanding a little more than what he has so far received in life <0>
{} they have a few more contacts with worldly people with mixed results <0>
pennys sleazy entertainment lawyer friend jon gries tries to talk them into becoming a freak show for him to promote and make a million bucks which causes them to temporarily turn against penny for bringing him around <0>
and then there is jesus garrett morris their next door neighbor who is fully into the jesus trip and brings the two to the hospital even though they didnt want to go <0>
the symbolism here is that even if religion means well it still does the wrong thing even when doing the right thing <0>
jesus should not have been so consumed with himself to think he was jesus and respected the twins wishes just like the worldly doctorfriend miles did when he examined them and knew that they came to the hotel to die together and let it go at that <0>
{} the polish twin brothers might be very close in character to the parts they play except for the physicality of being coupled <0>
so it is not surprising that they are very effective and convincing in their peculiar roles <1>
the female part of their menage a trois was played energetically by michele hicks but was a somewhat less believable role than the twins <-1>
the whore with a heart of gold is already a staple of film lore and she brings nothing new to the table with this performance <-1>
her acting contrasted between being particularly touching to being strident and at times she was not very accomplished in her part <-1>
the other characters and especially the mother had either too small a part to have an impact or were not developed at all <-1>
why the mother just abandoned the kids aside from being shocked by what she saw and what happened to the twins growing up never came out in the telling of the story <0>
when they were youngsters someone had to take care of them and should have seen to it that they got the operation to prevent them from becoming a freak show <0>
{} the intensity of the film and its haunting nature worked to its benefit as it made us see the twins as they are the film pulled no punches and stuck to the compelling nature of its subject matter <1>
but these same advantages also worked to the detriment of the film as the story was at times tiresome and rife with too much territory in which to go for all the problems it came up with <-1>
the film couldnt free itself from all the pain entailed in the three characters and kept making the story more and more muddled <-1>
an example of that would be the films ending where penny encounters the now single blake and possible romance is hinted at but the story just seems to be warming up as it ends on such an unclear note <-1>
{} this original film had too many flaws in its storytelling and never became an inspiring drama or an entertaining work <-1>
instead it is an interesting film that touches on a mature subject of how one can be both lonely while never being alone how siamese twins court a woman and also how they grow up to be deprived without a mothers love <1>
it should be commended for its mesmerizing style and enormous strength it showed in sticking with an unpleasant subject most films do not usually cover <1>
the brothers had something to say but perhaps it was too much for them to say in one film even in a film with a perfectly eerie cinematography to match its storyline <0>
it is a film that has its heart seemingly in the right place it nevertheless missed the boat on telling the sexual story it promised but never delivered <1>
a prostitute not having sex with a client who requested it is hard story to forget so easily as it seems if done right that could have been an innovative and moving scene and helped the film recover from being too bleak <0>
the film got caught up too much in the tragedy of the twins life and dwelt too much on the gravity of their situation without coming up with much more than heavy symbolism for its answers chopsticks broken in half a two dollar bill as change in a cab and later on the subject of a lecture by the good doctor telling how if the bill is torn in half it is not worth as much as if it were whole <-1>
i found those explanations to be too trite and since i was never fully convinced that this wasnt a manipulative film playing on the freakish nature of the brothers even if not sensationalizing it i left the theater not fully satisfied with all of the storyline <-1>

{} for a film that runs close to minutes is in bw and is short on storyline this bfilm does a nice job in getting a hugh cast to be part of this crime caper each getting into the act with a brief moment of quality movie time <1>
{} the suave star of the falcon series george sanders has grown tired of the role and wanted to move on to bigger and better things in hollywood so what better way to do it than to get his younger brother tom conway to become the next falcon private detective <0>
this is smoothly arranged in the script by rko as sanders gets knocked unconscious for most of the film and tom shows us that he can play the falcon with the same deftness as his russian born brother can <0>
when the surprise ending comes sanders gets himself killed off the series and graciously passes the role onto the future falcon who will appear in more of these lightweight crime stories <0>
the reason tom has a different name is because george came first and hollywood decided that tom should be the one to change his family name <0>
{} the falcons brother is a routine espionage story that is crisply told in a manner that is formularised and executed to perfection <2>
gay lawrence sanders goes to meet his brother tom conway coming in by boat from nassau whom he hasnt seen for years <0>
when he arrives with his stoogelike cohort lefty barclay he is told that his brother committed suicide <0>
but when he goes to identify the body he realizes that is not his brother but he doesnt tell that to inspector timothy donovan clark and instead follows an attractive woman diane melford andre who hurriedly leaves the boat <0>
{} the place she leads the falcon and lefty to is a womans fashion salon where the head designer is arlette wynters and her love interest is her underling paul harrington newill who is also having a relationship with the designer from the firm diane <0>
but before you can catch your breath and take in the fashion show going on diane is shot and the falcon is suspected of killing her by the police for revenge of his brothers death since she was dating him on the boat trip and the falcon was spotted by the police following her after she left the boat <0>
{} the falcon goes on the run collecting evidence on the way he already has the poison cigar that killed the unidentified body aboard the boat proving that it wasnt a suicide <0>
he runs into his brother in the alley and gets sideswiped by a car trying to kill him and this will incapacitate him for most of the film as tom without missing a beat takes over the case <0>
{} theres not much to the plot its about nazi agents trying to assassinate some south american diplomats and tom hooking up with a fashion model reporter marcie brooks randolph who has ambitions to land a job as a crime reporter and to land the handsome future falcon <0>
{} everything in this film goes as expected the cops are gently razzed the villains are easy to detect the romance is easy to handle the story is easy on the noggin and if you are not looking for anything fancy here youll extract your ounce of entertainment value from it <1>
if youve seen one falcon episode then you might as well have said youve seen them all <-1>
this one would rate as an average one <0>
the best one that sanders did is probably the first of his five the falcon takes over <0>
the reason they were so popular is because theyre so easy to watch and the stars exude a certain amount of charm making these little crime capers quite enjoyable <1>

[22584/c+]
{} this film based on carl sagans novel is a mixture of scifi romance sentimentality and drama brought to screen by the director of forreset gump <0>
it relies on its ideas and its mild convictions to sustain its powerful but soppy story rather than its special effects contrary to many modern films that have just become special effect vehicles <1>
the ellie arroway jodie role as a child of is played by jena malone who is being raised by her father with tender loving care her mother died at childbirth and with respect for her ability to learn as he encourages her interest in astronomy <0>
unfortunately he dies of a heart attack when she is just ten <0>
{} at last we see ellie grownup as an independent intelligent young lady working for the national science foundation on a project of cuttingedge technology <0>
jodie foster is feisty vulnerable appealing selfrighteous and obsessed with seeking scientific truths <0>
she is the alterego for sagan challenging the scientific and religious dogmas of the day championing a call for poetry and vision in our lives <0>
{} her boss palmer joss matthew feels her research is futile and of no utilitarian value <0>
he stops her alien contact project and is pictured as the perfect bureaucrat <0>
governments seem to trust this type and like to put them in charge of things <0>
{} ellie falls for a spiritual popularizer of worldly causes tom skeritt who left divinity school because he didnt want to remain celibate <0>
the attraction between them is overshadowed by idealogical differences and nothing can get in the way of ellies belief in evolution not even this hunk who is a ridiculously loopy caricature of a religious zealot one of those religious johnnycomelately types <0>
s r hadden john hurt comes to her rescue as an eccentric wealthy scientist on the lookout for adventurious scientists his foundation privately sponsors her research <0>
ellie succeeds in making contact with some sort of life in outer space and the government with michael kitz james woods in charge of security coopts her project for national security reasons <0>
here the story turns melodramatic and goes off on too many different tangents to adequately keep its focus on its primary aim that there is life in outer space <0>
for these scenes the film should have used the dictum from occams razor the simplest way to do something is the best way <0>
{} as a scifier with a good storyline that tends to get too schmaltzy this film is up to par with those star wars films but is outclassed by <1>
sagan would have been proud of the accuracy and content of this work had he lived to see the film through to its conclusion but i dont think he would have been to happy with the elementaryschool theological debate between the space pioneer and the government officials <-1>
the main argument in the film is when jodi is asked by that government panel whether she believes in the god of the bible <0>
it is an embarrassing scene as she waivers not trying to answer the question directly because if she said she didnt believe in god they wouldnt let her go up in space <0>
i think the best answer a scientist could give in this scenario was not given by jodi but then again she got to go up in space <0>
a steven hawkings might have said that it is through these scientific machines that we will come closest to reading the mind of god <0>
albert einstein might have said that the god of order created this beautiful world we live in and that the other kind of god the one of prayer and the one of interpretation by man and interjection is a speculative one <0>
that the world had to be created out of the first concept of god the world is not a result of an accident <0>
it is a thing of great beauty <2>
at least this is what my science friends tell me is the more typical attitude toward god in their community <0>

[20021/d]
{} this is not an art movie yet i saw it an art house theater <-1>
it is perfect for the mall where teenagers experiencing brain drains can feel good about being mindless and not have to apologize that this is an american film about that old cliche of young lovers relentlessly on the run <-1>
if seen at your friendly mall you could at least be reassured that there is little chance of anyone trying to sneak it in as an art film as was tried in the art house <0>
{} rlr should make it apparent that other countries can make obnoxious films with banal and predictable characters just as readily as americans can <-1>
there is no substance in this fast food german meal served up at a deliciously kinetic speed so that you have no time to think about how stupid the story is and how depraved the lead characters are and what a lousy meal you have just had <-2>
the film is as deep as reading a daffy duck comic book or playing a road runner video game or watching a bugs bunny cartoon and if that entertains you then perhaps i could recommend that you take a look at run lola run it might be what you are looking for <-1>
{} it has the audacity to have in its opening credits a quote from t s elliots little gidding about how the end in life is only the beginning <-1>
in all probability the bluebloodied elliott would not have cared for this film and to quote him and then have a film that has nothing in the world to do with his poem or with the quote except to show that even these crass critters who created this film aspire to a higher art form is simply a ridiculous attempt by them to try and achieve credibility when it is not necessary to do so this film stands on its own four paws <-2>
{} the filmmaker also asks the complex questions who are men <0>
where do they come from <0>
what is their aim in life <0>
these questions once asked on screen are of course never even attempted to be answered <-1>
though it would have been good comedic dialogue to have the two leads lola franka potente and manni moritz bleibtreu try to resolve these deep philosophical questions <0>
{} what does take place is a soccer ball being kicked to open the action in the film as the movie is supposed to be like a game with the director making up the rules as he goes along <0>
{} there is a slight plot to this film lolas boyfriend for the past year manni will be killed if he cant come up with marks which he got from a drug deal but lost the moneybag on the train to a bum blaming it on lola for not meeting him on her moped as planned her moped was stolen <0>
as manni frantically speaks to her on the phone telling her she must now meet him across town in minutes or else this guy who setup the deal ronnie is going to kill him now wouldnt that be a shame <0>
the only other thing to note is that lola is the punk rocker type with the raggedyann hairstyle of blazing reddishorange dyed hair and plenty of tattoos on her body <0>
manni not to be undone sports a few nifty tattoos himself while also taking on the punk look <0>
{} the fun to this story if you are going to have any comes in following lola as she makes a run for it through spots that she will revisit three different times each for minutes and with three different versions before the film is over as any one of the versions could be true or none of them could be true it just doesnt matter <1>
nothing matters here <0>
this is a disposable film like junk food when done you throw it in the waste can <-1>
the fun is in the run and the cartoonlike character she has become and in the reactions she gets from those that she meets on the way <0>
{} after he tells her hysterically on the phone his only chance to stay alive is to hold up a nearby supermarket she flings the red phone in the air and bolts out of her mothers apartment as a cartoon of her flashes on the tv screen and she rushes past her mom who is on the phone and next we see her running live on the street <0>
a few of her same markers will be a visit to her fathers bank an encounter with an ambulance and men crossing the street with a pane of glass boy what harold lloyd could have done with that vaudeville skit and a lady in the street who she keeps banging into <0>
the clock is rewound for each version as she starts over again in her mothers apartment going through the same routine but with different impressions and results <0>
{} needless to say anything goes here this film does not try to make sense and it doesnt <-1>
its comedy is on the low end of the totem pole of comedy though the old silent comedians such as charlie chaplin and buster keaton did bits similar to this but they had a logic to their madcap humor and knew how to tell a story in their comedy <-1>
the other thing this film tried unsuccessfully to do was show how chance could change ones life and make things turn out differently <-1>
there are so many films that tried this theme out for size some successfully like rashomon some modestly successful like blind chance others less successfully such as sliding doors but none as unsuccessful as this one <-2>
{} at least this subtitled lowbudget film flew by quickly and leaves you no worst for wear after seeing it <0>
it certainly didnt appeal to me i was just not smitten with its attempt to be such a cleverly edited jejune summer film <-1>
and to mimic one of the few attempts at dialogue in the movie when lola and manni try to form some sort of communication with each other to see if their love is for real and she asks him how does he know that he loves her and he replies i just know well i just know i didnt like this film <-2>

[22462/a]
{} this is a silent serial told in chapters about subversive vampire thieves as they suck the blood out of sleeping bourgeois parisian society stealing their jewels in novel and innovative ways <0>
the public loved these films until the talkie pictures came into being and this film was forgotten until rediscovered in the s by henri langlois and in the s by directors such as alain resnais and jacques rivette <0>
{} the vampires are led by the irrepressible irma vep musidora her name being an anagram for vampire <0>
musidora was a former music hall star whose raven hair and seductive looks suited her villainous blackgarbed heroine role in contrast to the sugary sweet blond american heroines at the time who starred in popular serials such as the perils of pauline and the exploits of elaine <0>
{} the films were shot cheaply and swiftly in the gaumont studios and on the surrounding parisian streets <0>
the combination of lyrical odd scenes of naturalism and the melodrama of a crimefiction story as the film is full of disappearances and disguises sudden deaths and uncanny resurrections hidden trapdoors and secret tunnels bus chases and rooftop escapes which gave the film its power its sense of dread perfectly matching the publics mood at the time of world war <0>
and it was that coupled with their almost anarchistic view of society the vampires steal only from the rich and their often contemptuous disregard of logic the result of tight shooting schedules that made the films so popular <0>
les vampires was treasured by surrealists like andre breton and louis aragon which gave it weight in intellectual circles also <1>
{} the serial ran into some trouble with the parisian chief of police who had one of the films episodes banned for glamorizing the criminals <0>
feuillade the former cavalryman and journalist atoned for his sin with more moralistic films in the future such as his judex <0>
{} les vampires is one of frances great classic contributions to the world of cinema and fortunately this once lost film has now been restored and is available on video <2>

{} its kitsch all right but nevertheless fine storytelling by the former nyu film school graduate m night shyamalan wide awake makes this moody ghost piece palpable <1>
it offers a superb performance from the year old elementary school aged boy lead cole sear played by the eleven year old haley joel osment <0>
this wellcrafted mystery is a firstrate summer entertainment vehicle flaws and allone large the story if examined carefully especially leading up to its surprise discovery would not hold up to careful scrutiny its all really hollywood hokum one medium ghosts cant move physical objects around this is pure hollywood invention and one minor ghosts dont leave marks on ones body though that was a ploy that added questions about parental abuse to the story making it fit into a modern problem in society <1>
this last point also gave the director a chance to make a cameo in the film as the doctor is shown having the mother sent to a social worker because of the nail scratching marks on the boys arm <0>
{} dr malcolm crowe bruce willis a gifted child psychologist in philadelphia who helps cole get it off his chest the dark secret that makes him think he is a freak of nature different than the other children just because he has the ability to see dead people in other words ghosts <0>
crowe is gentle with him listens well has a nice professional smile and devotes his whole sense of being to helping the child out something that gets the childs trust <0>
{} this secret is something he cant even tell his divorced mom lynn toni collette who works at two jobs to keep things going for them and loves him dearly but who even as she accepts him for what he is still fears that he is a bit strange <0>
though this rare psychic gift having a sixth sense enables him to see things clearly about the dead as they regularly visit him it also frightens him as he does not understand what the ghosts want from him as he tries to resist them and they sometimes leave bruises on his body <0>
this gift offers him little comfort in his daily life as he is friendless in school and burdened with selfdoubts about his sanity probably quite willing to trade it all in and be normal <0>
this afterall is quite a burden for the lad to have on his small shoulders <0>
{} dr malcolm crowes life is seemingly blissful doing a job he loves making a beneficial contribution to society and to boot receiving an award by the city of philadelphia in recognition for his work in helping children he also has a wife anna olivia whom he loves dearly while she in return also loves him very much and supports his work <0>
but there is a problem and that comes when he is tipsy one evening and there is a breakin to his upscale house as his failing effort with a child patient vincent gray donnie wahlberg is standing in the bathroom now an adult in his underwear as the doctor is slowly remembering his case <0>
the deranged former patient is telling him that he couldnt listen to him when he treated him he didnt understand what it meant to be alone and abruptly shoots him in the stomach angrily saying you failed me and then turns the gun on himself <0>
{} next fall we see a crestfallen dr crowe seemingly recovered from the gunshot follow cole into a church and in a concerned way offers to help him slowly gaining the childs trust through free association games and showing a genuine liking for the child in a nonjudgmental sort of way <0>
this is seen by him as a chance to help this deeply troubled boy and also gain professional redemption for his past failure <0>
{} willis is both likable and credible as the vulnerable doctor who develops a warm relationship with haley both sharing a sadness about the events in their lives <0>
the mother toni collette adds to the good rapport felt throughout the film by the three leads but has a minor role in getting through to haley mainly because she only wants to hear about good things and haleys visions are often violent ones <0>
{} haleys fright is convincing because he does not over emote the role but plays it as a child would who knows that adults dont like to hear things that are not understood by them <0>
so he speaks in a low almost hushed voice of haunting terror adding punch and gravity to his hallucinations and ghost stories making his frightful experience seem real <0>
{} what helps this story out enormously is that almost everyone you speak to has some strange tale themselves to tell about their contacts with a dead person <1>
if you dont believe that take note of the popular psychics such as a james van praagh and see how many calls they get about relatives communicating with those who are departed <0>
most psychics would say that the dead choose to communicate with those who are most receptive to them and that they might just be asking for some help from someone not realizing that they are dead or they are trying to help someone they care about see something that only they can see <0>
i dont think this film added much to our knowledge of the paranormal but it was an entertaining film plus it showed how a murder can be solved by having a sixth sense something that police sometimes find valuable in solving a crime <1>
the story was mildly chilling showing the boys visions of the dead people as real but without the gore that follows many of this genres usual commercial horror stories <1>
this escapist film allows you to take pleasure in this supernatural hokum perhaps even making you feel satisfied by the films surprise ending as you will probably not give this film another passing scary thought accepting it for the hollywood hokum it is thinking more about the cleverness of the plot than about whether or not ghosts exists <1>
i didnt find anything deeper than a good story told here and for that the filmmaker did an admirable job <1>

{} happiness is not a film about happiness because happiness is not real but imagined therefore no one can stay happy in a world where sadness is the more prevalent emotional state <0>
so goes the theme of this dark comedy meant to shock and antagonize you into looking at people you cannot readily identify with in a film that features a pedophile rapist dylan a murderer camyrn an obscene caller hoffman a masturbator read a russian immigrant thief jared and an assortment of losers and lonely people wrapped up in their egos as solondzs morbid sense of humor turns to new jerseys suburbs to explore the depravity of the human race <0>
{} this is an honestly made film that refuses to compromise on its plot or who should be cast in it solondz refused the studios offer to cast the pedophile with a noted star such as william hurt because he felt dylan was just right for the role <1>
this film is meant for an art house type of audience one that is able as difficult as it may be to see something in themselves in the characters portrayed on screen <1>
i would wonder about anyone who could sit through this film and not be disturbed by it that would just defeat its purpose <1>
the audience i saw this film with were mostly williams college students and faculty and they laughed openly and freely at the parts that had an edge to it where solondz was going for the laugh because he pushed the button as far as he wanted to go with a certain character and in order to return to the intensely grim psychological mood of the story he had to release some humorous energy or have the film drown in its own murky waters <1>
the laughter was appropriate and even hip as it felt right to see this with an audience that still felt the need to be entertained when they go to the movies and it didnt seem to matter if the laughter came about from the cruel humor it evoked causing people to react as a group rather than individually <1>
i found that most people in the audience appeared to be nervously silent and there was at no time just one person alone laughing but the best part is that only one person walked out of the theater and no one hissed <0>
{} happiness is a difficult picture to watch there are no good guys or gals <0>
in order for it to work as a complete film one has to accept the interrelated tales of three different types of sisters and their relationship with their miserable parents gazzara and lasser who dont love each other and are not happy whatever they do he has given up on everything including getting a divorce and she feels a need to cling to this loveless marriage no matter what <0>
{} the sisters all suffer from egocentredness and it takes an audience with a modicum of sympathy for each of them to get past all the vices each of them has as each one in this story only pretends to be interested in anyone but themselves <0>
{} jane adams plays joy who is anything but joyous as she cries through most of the film having no luck at finding the right job or man <0>
trish cynthia is the oldest and seemingly the most content parroting all the facile virtues of middle america living out the american dream with her three wonderful kids and successful psychologist husband dylan who is gentle and understanding but hides from her the fact that he is a pervert and a pedophile <0>
it is also interesting to note in the analysis he undergoes that he only tells his analyst the dreams he wants to tell seemingly to satisfy the analyst and not damage his career while he neglects to tell the analyst his true sexual feelings <0>
solondz closes the door for any of his characters to get the help they need <0>
{} lara flynn boyle plays helen the successful author who cant stand who she is who is so full of herself constantly harping to her sisters how she has been with so many good looking men and is never lonely but complains that she just has too much to do <0>
she is also materially very welloff and condescending to her sisters <0>
this illusion of her good life is shattered when an obscene caller a nerdy computer guy hoffman turns her on with one of his calls and she makes a date with him even after he hangs up on her but he is apparently afraid of her too willing response to his proposition so their relationship fizzles out <0>
by chance he is also undergoing analysis with our shrink dylan so you know what kind of help he is getting for his problems <0>
{} the most poignant and unflinching scenes in the film are between the accused pedophile father and his son read as dylan who is superb in his role honestly counsels his yearold son about masturbation and later on has the difficult task of telling his son that he drugged and raped his sons friend and then raped one of his other friends and would do it again because he cant control himself <1>
i could understand people being upset with this character as this character is given a forum to tell us what he is about and as difficult as it is to feel anything but contempt for him we at least see what this type of person looks like up close and we can ascertain that he is human no other film to my knowledge has done this so thoroughly and has done it so humanely and perceptively in fact very few films would have enough balls to touch this subject langs m with peter lorre does to a certain degree but langs film was different in nature and just touched bases with the peripheral nature of the problem he never pushed it to the front of the film and into the face of the audience his was mostly a noir crime story while solondzs film centers on exploring ones disturbing emotional states <1>
{} this is a very solid film that is wellacted that is understandably not for everyone yet because it takes risks on subjects that are tabu and even though some of the risks seemed contrived and not a part of the natural story line this is still a powerful film one deserving of attention and intelligent critique one deserving of thanks from those of us who welcome a true effort for the sake of art even if the art has to sink into the mud to have its story told <2>
many filmmakers have approached the subject of happiness by tacking on a happy ending to their films <0>
that is not the case with this film obviously <0>
this film leaves you little choice you can take this film as morbid and amusing as it is or you can ignore it or you can find no one in it that you feel some sort of compassion for and therefore come to hate it <0>
i came close to loving it while not exactly loving it mainly because there were too many scenes in it that left me with mixed feelings and messages <1>
but close to loving it means i liked it a lot for its honesty to subject matter and character <1>
i did however think that these characters went too far in their portrayals for me to relate to them without either feeling sorry for them or despising them <1>

{} strange is the norm for this exquisitely made first fulllength live action feature from the americanborn they work in london identical twins stephen and timothy quay who have previously achieved cult status for their animation films <1>
this dreamlike fantasy film probably a fairytale story gone amok filmed in the style of german expressionism ala the cabinet of dr caligari and most reflective of a kafkaesque type of story depicting a man trapped by absurd circumstances and his mistrust of society as the film sets a nightmarish tone <1>
it is loosely based on the novella jakob von gunten by the swiss author robert walser <0>
{} the institute benjamenta is a boarding school for servants where the lessons are taught by the siblings the eccentric despot johannes benjamenta gottfried john and the fragile beauty lisa benjamenta alice krige <0>
she teaches by being repetitive to the point of being ridiculous and surreal as the course of study consists of repeating the lesson over and over such as the lesson in setting the dining table as ritualistically the wouldbe servants keep repeating in unison what their ethereal teacher tells them as she paces back and forth in front of the blackboard holding onto a pointer made of a deer foot <0>
there are deer antlers that hang on the walls and pine cones and needles on the floors of the classroom <0>
the use of deer must hold some symbolic meaning to the story but i would only be guessing as to exactly what <0>
the lessons take place in a dilapidated building with a creepy looking and uninviting interior setting the claustrophobic atmosphere the film thrives on <0>
the ceilings in the students rooms are too low to stand up in ala dr caligari <0>
{} the film follows its story through the eyes of jakob von gunten mark rylance who is first seen knocking on the schools door and looking through the peephole at a monkey as he is about to enroll <0>
he states that he came to this placewhich seems to be cut off in time and location from the rest of the world looking for a chance to be of service to someone in this life <0>
he will remain here until the school crumbles as it seems to be coming to a slow but sure end as the director announces no more students will be taken in after jakob <0>
{} what is the reality of life if everything can be turned upside down and what does reality mean might be some of the things the film is questioning that is if one were looking for a theme to this intriguing tale filmed in a grainy blackandwhite monochrome which added to the films evocative mood <1>
another theme might be the jesus motif of how can one be like christ a humble servant in a society that craves order and for people to know their place in that order <0>
jakob asks is there anything jesus could do for us in this world <0>
the answer seems to be become a servant <0>
{} the film succeeds in being a hypnotic work of much visual merit that is different in scope and in intention than other films probably defying classification into a type of genre it belongs to <2>
there is hardly any dialogue and the sparse dialogue that is there does not seem to be that pertinent to the story as the actors recite their lines as if they were puppets on a string being manipulated by the quays <-1>
the sister asks at one point am i living in a fairy tale <0>
{} but it is the aesthetics that seem to count for what are the dramatics of the film <1>
its story of the high and the low in status each accepting unconditionally their place in society are examined in a most bizarre fashion in the students and his masters mannerisms as all the repressed students who willingly serve at their masters discretion go through their eerie robotic movements and the story has the look of a spellbinding fairytale <1>
{} what is also shown is how twisted and sexually repressed the siblings are him in need of jakob as his confidante and slave showing how fearful he is of life while she is caressing jakobs cheeks as if to comfort herself but it could also be a tabu romantic gesture toward jakob indicating their separation is due to class differences <0>
and of the eight students kraus daniel smith stands out as one wholly accepting of the arrangement of servant and master accepting without a peep of protest the schools dehumanization policy <0>
{} the film runs its course with alternating moods of exhileration and tedium but proves itself to be visually stimulating overall with every scene showing the contrasts between the light and dark of life <1>
there was also the memorable weird scene in the beginning of the film where a face appears distorted through a goldfish bowl <1>
{} at the films conclusion jakob questions what he has learned if he has really become insignificant implying that instead of things being a mystery such as the face in the gold fish bowl knowing about things can be attained by doing what is habitual as when kraus teaches him how to clean the bowl which is enough for him to learn <0>
{} what it all means is subject to ones imagination so much of the film is purposely left unclear as jakob wrestles with whether he should rescue lisa from her melancholy life <0>
but this unsettling film is nevertheless diverting in a positive intellectual way even as it is subject to much speculative interpretation <1>
you can look at it as a visionary poem or as an allegory on life either way the film is original and stimulating if one can take the very slow pace of its camera work and its tenor of dull melancholy and its inconclusiveness into proper consideration <1>
{} the film was stylishly scored by polish composer lech jankowski <0>

[19880/a+]
{} simply put this is one of the best crime films ever made <2>
especially considering that it was made on a budget of only <2>
it most closely resembles in style and scope the work of the great french directors jeanpierre melville and jacques becker as a classic noir tale depicting mans foibles of greed and betrayal <1>
the killing here refers to a heist of the racetrack for a sum of million dollars as planned by excon johnny clay sterling who rounds up a crew of nonprofessional criminals for this caper <0>
he wants to make one big score before retiring <0>
the robbery itself is told in multiple flashback style as each character gets a chance to tell his version of the story which is done in parts so that each characters story is not only told but the film is able to jump back and forth in time allowing for several events to happen together <0>
{} the cuckolded george peatty elisha is a race track betting window cashier mike oreilly joe sawyer is a racetrack bartender with a sick wife randy corsia is a corrupt cop marvin unger flippen is the one bankrolling the job nikki arane carey is the memorable psychotic marksman hired for to kill a racehorse maurice kola is a chessplaying strongman who for will cause a fight at the track and thereby create a necessary disturbance calling for lots of police <0>
each ones job is a key one in helping johnny gain entry to the office where the money is kept <0>
if they dont work in coordination with each other the plan wouldnt work <0>
{} the complications to this wellplanned scheme come through georges sexy wife sherry the femme fatale who is seeing a petty gangster behind georges back val vince <0>
she is shrewdly able to sneak the details of the robbery out of her dim husband whom she detests as much as he worships her <0>
she also clearly had the two best lines in the film if people didnt have headaches what would happen to the aspiren industry <0>
when george kills her after she betrays him she is able to say right before keeling over this is a bad joke without a punch line <0>
{} when nikki kills the racehorse he is immediately shot the rest of the robbery goes smoothly but when johnny returns to pay off the boys sherrys two henchmen who got there first kill every one except for george who kills them and then goes back to his place to get sherry he will subsequently die from his wounds <0>
meanwhile johnny and his girlfriend get unlucky at the airport as their suitcase full of money opens up and scatters all over the airport <0>
as johnny is taken into custody at the airport terminal by a pair of detectives he is too weary to make a run for it <0>
{} what makes this film so tense and gripping is the exacting details that went into making this caper work as it is seen through the eyes of the odd mixture of characters who commit the robbery <1>
each one drooling for their share of the easy money unconcerned that they have become blind about the criminal act they are doing <0>
the point made is a theme that kubrick will return to many times in his long career in films that their perfect robbery fails because of the human condition they couldnt control and not because the robbery wasnt perfectly executed <0>
{} the main protaganist shows that he is capable of loyalty and love and of possibly leading a virtuous life but whose downfall comes about when he cant stop being a criminal to gain the something he cant find inside his true nature <0>
it fits in with kubricks notion of life that it is vital for one to see how the pieces are played out on the chess board and how the player who does not always have the best strategy or execution can still win by learning how to persevere and change as the game does <1>
as one of kubricks early features it remains one of his greatest films even without the added visual dimensions he was to pour into his later highbudget more complex movies <1>
the outstanding cast made everything look natural and the gritty realism of the story was only enhanced by the glorious bw cinematography <2>

[21318/c]
{} this films narrative promises much to say about how violent man is as it uses contemporary l a for its location <0>
but in the end it fails to deliver the goods for reasons that are not artistically clear to me wenders decides to abruptly check out of this slow developing nonstory and end it without resolving it satisfactorily <-1>
the film seemed to be oozing completely out of energy and purpose <-1>
it made me wonder why wenders seemed to be so concerned in the first place with the sociopolitical manifestations of a topsecret government project gone awry and the public being exploited by hollywood and then he concentrated for most of the film on the usual crime stuff of murder and missing persons basically ignoring what he tried so hard to bring to center stage <-1>
{} i have always found wenders to be a bit pretentious and at the same time alluring <1>
he always seems to bait me into thinking there is something more to his films than there are <1>
there are exceptions like his wonderful film wings of desire but most of the time i feel that i am being intellectually shortchanged by such deceptions <-1>
this picture is a perfect example of what i mean <0>
{} at first the story appears to be about mike max pullman <0>
he plays this bastard hollywood movie producer who has gotten wealthy making exploitive action films and who it seems cant communicate with his fine looking but empty wife paige andie he can only communicate bottomlines and is hooked on cellular phones and on computers <0>
{} his wife is leaving him because he either constantly ignores her or dumps on her <0>
then the main event of the film takes place as we observe on video surveillance in an observatory with telescopes and computers and video cameras that ray bering gabriel byrne who is a computer expert is watching two hitmen trying to kill mike after kidnapping him <0>
instead they endup dead and mike is found by some mexican gardeners as he wanders along the road <0>
he will now live with them that is after telling them he is the famous producer they see on the news but is now considered to be a missing person <0>
{} the action turns to following the life of cat traci who is the stunt woman mike gave a big break to giving her a starring role in his next film <0>
the cop doc block loren who is investigating the disappearance of mike is suspiciously pulled off the case when he starts asking too many questions around the set but stays around long enough to fall for cat and continue the investigation on his own <0>
{} the detectives investigation reveals that the video surveillance was a government plan used to spy on people to cut down on the police response times to crime and byrne the computer security expert who is setting this up for the government is afraid of its inherent dangers such as the abuse of power this technology has for society <0>
he has picked mike after just meeting him once at a computer convention in las vegas to tell him about this classified project <0>
so it seems that our government boys are now going after mike and mike tells this to cat who tells this to doc block <0>
the most interesting and diverting scenes in this part of the film concern the poetry performance readings that some of the movie folks attend <1>
one of the readings is more powerful than anything that has to do with the story being told <0>
a black woman poet parker does a poem about being taken sexually by her father <0>
this is wenders being the arty wenders creating interest by being evocative no matter what the film calls for <1>
i am not challenging his use of such scenes they are wonderful but i am put off by his inability to keep the story from going cold <-1>
{} the last part of this narrative has all these parts of the tale come together for a violent conclusion <0>
it leaves us with the belief that the violence will not be curtailed but will go on therefore there will be no such a thing as an end to violence <0>
thereby the films title is the opposite of what the film really means to say <0>
or is it <0>
{} wenders has succeeded in creating a mishmash of images that are incendiary but not penetrating enough for us to believe in the characters of the story or to follow through on what this film is supposed to be about <-1>
in fact you might be angrier and more prone to have a violent reaction to the film than you would be to believe that wenders has taken this film in the direction needed for us to see what is meant by an end of violence <-1>
{} he lost me somewhere down the line <-1>
it seems to be a film concerned about government conspiracies and missing persons but turns out to be more concerned with societal problems values and alienation and does not do any of these topics sufficient justice in covering it <-1>
this results in a film that has a few good ideas but goes astray leaving it with a disjointed look that is artistically satisfying to watch but empty of meaningful inquiry <1>

[20332/c-]
{} celebrity is like an amalgam of old woody allen materials which has always given him an opening to concentrate on being witty and ignoring such filmmaking details as editing and plot <0>
he seems to work well in chaos and in hyperboles <-1>
this fluff film no pretense at ingmar bergman depths here could have been funny but it isnt except in brief spots <-1>
as far as being insightful about the horses arses who are into being celebrities without any other accomplishments to their credit theres not really too much to be said that could be profound about that subject matter it is obvious how shallow a fate just being a celebrity is <0>
woody makes a stronger statement in the films subplot that deals with love as he believes that meeting the right mate is mostly a matter of luck <0>
{} here kenneth branagh is not woody allen but he plays woody and it doesnt work out that well <-1>
hes just not funny all hes got down pat are woodys voice inflections and neurotic gestures <-1>
its as if he is a robot who looks the part but cant really be the part because he is isnt humanly programed that way <-1>
in this rambling celebrity hunt of a movie where he plays a celebrity journalist working on a novel and on a film script roaming the environs of nycs tribeca elaines restaurant and the places of high fashion he becomes the loser who keeps making bad decisions about his personal and career life <0>
{} branagh is shown via flashbacks divorcing his nervous catholic teacher wife judy davis without explaining why as he stutters out his inarticulate response <0>
as the film moves on we see that branagh is a phony using woman only to get ahead in his career <0>
we first see this as he conducts an interview profiling the life of a famous actress melanie griffith in the house she lived in as a child <0>
he romances her in the same bedroom she slept in as a child and audaciously tries to get her interested in his screenplay while he is in her arms romantically saying he needs a star to be in the film for him to get his screenplay backed <0>
{} he is going out of his sexual mind when he meets the supermodel charlize theron who shows him how she has orgasms when touched on any part of her body <0>
she sexually dances with nba basketball player anthony mason and gives him her number in front of him <0>
if woody played that scene it most probably would have been funny but with branaugh it seemed pathetically flat and unfunny <-1>
{} the only scene in the film that had a bit of spice in it that lasted for more than seconds was the leonardo dicaprio bit where hes a famous badboy actor who branagh tries to pitch his screenplay to in a hotel room as he is beating up his girlfriend gretchen mol and trashing the room allthewhile branagh continues pushing his screenplay on him <1>
they end up going to see a fight in atlantic city him borrowing from leonardo and losing that same money at the casino craps table then going back to the hotel to party on some coke and participate in an orgy with a groupie who tells him she writes like chekhov all the time pitching unsuccessfully for his screenplay <0>
{} he steals famke janssen who is a book editor away from another and has her move in with him as she helps him with his screenplay <0>
but he meets again the very attractive and ambitious waitressactress winona ryder that he was supposed to date in an earlier scene and dumps famke on the day she alters her entire life to move in with him <0>
meanwhile his exwife finds mr perfect a television producer joe mantegna she marries him gets to be a popular tv host of a celebrity interview show and has one hilarious scene where she goes privately to see a hooker bebe guest on the celebrity tv show to learn the art of giving good head <0>
the hooker asks her what she thinks about when she is giving a blow job and she responds the crucifixion <0>
a banana is used as a prop for the sexual demonstration in selfimprovement until the expert chokes on it and the demonstration comes to a halt <0>
{} another funny bit took place in the green room of famkes tv show where waiting klansman an aclu attorney skinheads a rabbi and a mafia don discuss who is representing them from the william morris agency as the rabbis biggest concern is if there are any bagels left <1>
{} the film was reeltoreel with celebrities as they made their cameo and disappeared <0>
donald trump is buying st patricks cathedral and tearingitdown for a skyscraper <0>
a producer says he is remaking birth of a nation with an all black cast <0>
famous for being in a coma sonny klaus von bulows wife lays in a coma but is wheeled out to appear on the celebrity tv show <0>
celebrities give trite comments to banal questions such as what do you think of the rain <0>
answer its really something <0>
{} the beautifully shot bw film ends as it begins as a plane passes overhead with the skywriting word help <1>
this was a film that had no idea how to put this story together it seemed so lifeless and flat indeed in need of help <-2>
for starters none of the main characters were cast right and especially branaugh theres no way no matter how exact his mimicry of woody is that he can be thought of as a neurotic nebbish nyc jew <-1>
what was needed was some originality and some energy into making the characters appear absurdly funny and not carbon copy imitations of how celebrities are <-1>
the few jokes in the film were far and few between and could not overcome the tired feeling emanating from the rambling story <-2>
woody is slipping his last few films have been heading on a steady downward path <-1>

{} a seaplane crash lands on the waters of some deserted south pacific island and the six diverse passengers plus the pilot and the stewardess on board remove themselves from the wreck and take a dinghy ashore where they will find things look hopeless and could be getting worse <0>
{} the pilot jack bennett gregson is a disgruntled man carrying on a futile love affair with the attractive stewardess teresa pier angeli and is dissatisfied with this secondrate airline he works for and with his copilot willy linder <0>
willy is finding it difficult to follow the captains orders and rebels by doing whatever he wants to do <0>
when the plane makes a fuel stop and picks up some more passengers on a small island he doesnt get the proper amount of fuel the captain asks him to get because he is anxious to get back to his home and quit this job he dreads and he doesnt want to get stuck in this primitive island waiting for the bureaucrats to finally grant him all the fuel needed <0>
a hurricane warning is issued but because of the poor radio equipment they have which was not properly repaired by willy the message is cut off and they dont know how serious that storm will be <0>
but willys most fatal mistake was to purchase fire extinguishers that were cheap but would comply in appearance with the air safety codes <0>
it was purchased at the price this airline run on a shoestring could afford the only trouble was that they were the wrong type of extinguishers for an airplane and if used they can cause deadly fumes to be released rather than extinguish the fire <0>
of course there was a fire on the plane and the extinguisher was used by a passenger rushing into the cockpit to help out and before he could be stopped by the copilot from using it the damage was done as the fumes killed the copilot and knocked the pilot unconscious <0>
{} the two original passengers from the flight are the prim and haughty englishwoman miss shaw jean anderson who turns out to be a good egg after all and a german physics professor krauss gunnar who is on his way to australia to accept a teaching position there <0>
{} petersen clifford is a cop on assignment to arrest the brash captain of the sea spray mark eddie for smuggling <0>
his information that the captain is a smuggler comes from the britisher the very slimy whitey attenborough a weasel if there ever was one <0>
whitey is given an airline ticket to testify in court against mark and if he does that he will then get his reward money <0>
the handcuffed mark when he gets a chance to be uncuffed by the cop who has to go to the bathroom threatens whitey by telling him what will happen to him if he testifies in court <0>
this scares the living daylights out of the prevaricator <0>
mark is the one who mistakenly used the fire extinguisher and was forced to land the plane with the help of the revived pilot who still had no strength in his hands to navigate it <0>
{} maria eva bartok is the popular bon vivant world traveler where every island she stops at is paradise <0>
she is a romantic friend of marks but cant get closer to him than that <0>
her role in the film is never developed as it is based on a generalization of what someone like her should be like <0>
{} the marooned passengers discover that they are on an island that has cattle in lead sheltered buildings and an empty fleet of ships docked around the side of the island and they soon realize that this is an island used as a nucleartest site and in a few hours a nucleartest bomb will explode on the island <0>
{} the physics professor tells them that the next island they see which is two miles away has the detonators that will cause the chainreaction for the bomb to go off and that if they can get to that island they can stop the explosion from occurring <0>
one of the problems is that whitey is intimidated by mark and doesnt like it that the cop has uncuffed his prisoner so when he gets a chance he steals the cops gun and the planes dinghy taking it to the next island <0>
the problem now is that the professor cant swim so he has to teach mark how to detonate the reactors <0>
in the meantime teresa goes diving into the water to find the toolbox in a search for the tools mark will need to do his mission <0>
she nearly drowns doing this but is saved by mark and the two passionately kiss on the beach <0>
this kiss is seen by the dismayed pilot <0>
{} the films ending is routine formula fare with a few predictable surprises of heroism and villainy the kind of middling story churned out regularly by the studios who lack the imagination to delve into anything but superficial waters <-1>
so what you have is familiary known as a typical disaster b movie a precursor to all those other movies of this genre that were very popular with audiences from the late s on <0>
the film fits into the formula mold that studios use over and over again with the obligatory tense action scenes and the typical danger scenes that call for a hero to be manufactured <0>
in this film mark acts as a hero and stops the bomb and the crash victims get rescued with two seconds left or something like that <0>
you know what i mean everyone who watches films over the years will run across one like this one which by the way wasnt too bad of a film to watch <1>
the actors had enough vigor in them to keep it going and the story seemed to move along at a brisk and mindless pace <2>

{} can you imagine that this innovative creative film a groundbreaker for its time managed to virtually end the career of its great and noted director as the subjects sexual content was too much to take for so many of the selfrighteous critics of that time <2>
this is a film about scoptophilia voyeurism the morbid urge to gaze or as it is more commonly called being a peeping tom <0>
{} mark lewis carl is a cameraman with a great psychological problem he is fixated on taking pictures of females bringing on a fear in them by pointing a spear at them then having them watch themselves in a mirror as he kills them <0>
his father was a scientist who experimented with mark when he was young by filming him constantly shining lights in his eyes to wake him from sleep throwing lizards in his bed and always testing his young son to see how he reacts to fear <0>
when marks mother dies the father michael powell plays this part in the home movies shown quickly remarries upsetting the youngster even further <0>
he gives mark a camera as a gift and this starts marks obsession with voyeurism <0>
{} when his father dies mark inherits the house which he rents out to an assortment of tenants <0>
coming home one evening a st birthday party is being given for one of the tenants helen anna who is strangely attracted to this very shy awkward man who she doesnt realize is the landlord <0>
she visits him in his apartment and he takes her into his darkroom and shows her his ghastly home movies <0>
and even though he acts very peculiar she remains interested in him and he shows that he likes her and will not harm her <0>
{} meanwhile there is a murder that occurs in the same style as the previous one reported in the newspapera where the victim has died with a dreaded look of fear this one takes place in the film studio where he works as a focuser which brings in the police to investigate <0>
on his other job where he works for a newstand dealer he takes pictures of models who pose for him in sexually alluring ways <0>
he murders one of the models knowing full well that the police are tailing him <0>
he even films the police as they are closing in to catch him <0>
he says that this is all part of the documentary he is shooting <0>
{} mark lewis is this pathetically gentle psychopath who has a compulsion to kill brought on by his early childhood years who cannot even be saved by love as his compulsion to kill and die is stronger than anything else <0>
this fascinating film is as intensely good as any thriller done by hitchcock or chabrol <2>
its intensity and compelling characterization of mark is a landmark in films <2>

{} a seminal work in teen films shot appropriately in bw except for the fish <1>
it tells the story of troubled teens in tulsa and their yearnings for the good ole days of gang wars <0>
it is an arty some critics say pretentious film about a punky street kid rusty james dillon who idolizes his older brother the motorcycle boy rourke <0>
he has been a hoodlum legend for the kids in the neighborhood but now has second thoughts about his life as he returns from california to give his brother a chance to escape the life he is stuck in <0>
their alcoholic father is played by dennis hopper with all the odd tics and mannerisms he seems to muster for the peculiar characters he always seems to play <0>
{} rumble fish are fighting fish who will try and kill themselves if shown their own reflection and other fish if they are taken out of their natural habitat and placed in fish tanks <0>
that is the message of the film as rourkes last desperate act is to free these pet store fish to the river as he exhorts his brother to ride away from his home city <0>
it is his hope that by getting his brother far away from his bad upbringing he will learn to find out who he really is <0>
{} what works very well for coppola is the overall mood he captures of how the inner city kids react to their identity crises <0>
we see how they are turned off by school and how they dont have proper parental guidance it is also pointed out that if these kids had the proper role models things might be a lot different for them <0>
their main problem is that they find themselves in troublesome situations that they cant handle by themselves <0>
rusty can fearlessly fight and he can attract girls but he cant think straight <0>
he cant be a gang leader as one of his street pals smokey cage tells him because he is on a death course and no one would follow him for long no one really wants to die with him <0>
{} the motorcycle kid is an existential hero saying very little but if you get into his rap he is more likely to be a hero found in a camus story than in a teen film <0>
that makes his characterization seem controversial and arbitrary here <0>
he is a gigantic adult figure as compared to the others we see in the film such as his alcoholic father and the neighborhood cop who hates his guts for being a hero to these kids <0>
he has a swagger to him and a way about him that makes him larger than life even mythic <0>
he sees the world without a true sense of colors <0>
besides not being prejudice he is actually physically color blind <0>
we see how this affects him when he rides his cycle through a red light and how he walks the drug infested sleazy streets in town oblivious of all the different shades of faces he sees and the danger that is all around him <0>
{} his kid brother is dumb he just doesnt get things and is heading for a disastrous life <0>
when he has an affair with a girl he really seems to like patty diane he loses her because he doesnt have enough common sense to treat her right <0>
everything he does ends in violence or in an incomprehensible situation <0>
he has no plans for himself and gives no thought about the future <0>
there was not really anything new revealed about this sort of character that hasnt been seen in other teen films but the film does have the gritty feel of reality to it and intelligence in how the story was presented <1>
{} im on the side of those who liked this emotionally wrought stylized film adapted from a novel by s e hinton warts and all <1>
it brought a higher quality to this teen genre film than usually seen in such films even if i doubt if it would reach the troubled kids the film was about who in all probability would not choose to see such an arresting film <1>
to the films credit it was not a glossy look at the kids it had the good sense to stay true to its theme without just blaming society for the problems presented <1>

{} a s scifi schlockfilm cueing in on the cold war paranoia regarding nuclear bombs and turning the stalworth colonel manning glenn langan into a later day king kong who attacks las vegas <-1>
this bmovie made in bw is a cheapie from americaninternational pictures and is good for a few laughs and a few shakes of the head <0>
{} at the site of the first plutonium bomb explosion in nevada colonel manning as part of security forces observes a manned plane that goes down just as it is about to hit zero hour for the explosion <0>
he disobeys orders and rushes out from his secure shelter to rescue the downed pilot but hes too late the blast occurs exposing him to its radiation and all he can do is shield his eyes but all his skin is peeled off and his vital fluids are drained <0>
{} by some miracle he is still alive and is being attended to in the hospital when his anxious fiance carol forrest cathy downs visits him <0>
dr paul lindstrom hudson is treating him and notices something unusual he has grown back all new skin and he cant stop growing <0>
at the rate he is growing to feet a day he will die unless the scientists can come up with a way for them to stop the cells from growing <0>
{} manning has flashbacks of the korean war and the terrible foxhole incident where his sergeant got killed and he had to kill a few koreans to escape <0>
he also promised to marry carol after the war which he planned to do right after the nuclear test was finished <0>
{} meanwhile he has grown gigantic and realizes that he cant be helped though carol keeps his spirits up by telling him the doctors are working on a way to stop his growth <0>
when he tries to read the bible it has shrunk so much that the print is too small for him to read <0>
it is also a trip to watch this bald headed giant eat like a giant does and to see how he simply dwarfs all those who visit him <0>
{} disillusioned with what he has become he thinks he has become a freak show someone to be advertised on a circus tour with a barker calling out come see the amazing colossal man <0>
his mind is starting to go and the doctors say if they cant come up with a remedy pronto his heart which is not growing at the same pace as his body will not be able to support him anymore <0>
{} the doctors think they have the solution and prepare a giant hypodermic needle with some kind of sulfur solution that will go into his bone marrow and stop the cells from reproducing <0>
but manning has become deranged telling carol to leave him alone and he escapes heading for las vegas <0>
the army under the supervision of colonel hallock seay look for the easy to spot giant he is now feet tall and weighs pounds with orders to shoottokill if he disobeys them <0>
{} in las vegas he peers in on a lady taking a bath on one of the top floors of her hotel and tears off the icons on top of the gambling casinos such as the one from the silver slipper <0>
it now becomes a question if they can save him in time <0>
{} the best sequence in the film is of doctors coulter and lindstrom carrying the huge hypodermic needle toward him as he heads away from las vegas and goes toward boulder dam <0>
they ram the needle into him but he pulls it out and throws it like a spear into coulters heart and then he does to her what king kong did to fay wray on the empire state building as he puts carol who he can barely recognize into his paw <0>
when he is talked into putting her down by lindstrom the army sharpshooters put him out of his misery and he falls into boulder dam <0>
{} the special effects were fine the quasi documentary atmosphere it presented helped give it the look of a cold war era film the movie was seriously done but nevertheless it was hilarious <1>
what the film failed to do was be anything but cynical <-1>
it had no particular political objectives it did not follow through about how the civilian population is effected in regards to army secrecy in such nuclear tests nor did it explore what significance if any was there in having the giant attack americas new city of wealth and greedy dreamslas vegas <-1>
for all its failings and ridiculous dialogue i nevertheless enjoyed watching this minutes of hokum <1>
mercifully the film wasnt any longer <0>

{} the film opens with popaul yanne a veteran of years army service recently returned to his birthplace perigord region to be the towns butcher taking over his fathers butcher store upon his death as we see him joyously cutting some slices of meat for the wedding celebration of the teacher leon hamel mario beccara whos marriage is being celebrated in this small oldfashioned french village as the butcher sits next to the smiling young and attractive headmistress of leons school helene st ephane audran <0>
{} popaul comes a courting helene making her an offer she cant resist he will personally choose the meat she gets promising her the best cuts available <0>
why popaul is not married can be explained by his army service taking him to remote spots on the globe <0>
he did not like the service saying he saw many terrible things there so many dead people as a result of war even though he was only a butcher there it had an awful affect on him <0>
{} helene comes from the city she said she came here to get away from everybody the reason is that she loved someone years ago who abruptly left her leaving her psychologically scarred and very hurt <0>
she found it very easy and gratifying to give all her love to the children <0>
the townspeople consider her to be an excellent teacher and so she lives happily alone <0>
{} soon a murdered old woman is found in the woods who was not raped <0>
this does not disturb our butcher who comes by the school offering helene a leg of lamb as if it were a bouquet <0>
helene whose whole life is focused around the school lives upstairs from the schoolroom she teaches in <0>
popaul is respectful of her as she chooses to remain friendly but aloof from him as this strange relationship is bound by a certain chemistry they might have for each other even though they are very different in temperament <0>
{} the most memorable scene in the film is when the children are on an outing in the woods and one of the girls is about to bite into her roll when a red spot appears on it looking like jam <0>
it turns out to be blood dripping down from a body on the cliff above them <0>
when helene goes to examine the body she discovers its her colleagues new bride <0>
she also picks up a cigarette lighter that she gave to the butcher as a birthday present <0>
it is puzzling that she doesnt tell this to the police detective who questions her <0>
that she doesnt say anything but continues seeing popaul strikes me as odd <0>
but this is what adds to the flavor of this methodically simple story <1>
the flawed characters are what elevate this film into something other than a straight mystery story because getting the murderer is not the theme of the film as much as trying to understand something that is complex about human nature <1>
{} by now we are familiar with life in the village we have seen the statue of the soldier in the village square by the schoolhouse everytime someone visits the school it is as if he was guarding the sacredness of this school and is a symbol of how society ruins its young men with untold wars <0>
{} it is hard to figure what is happening internally in the budding relationship between popaul and helene but it is definetly not a sexual one <0>
perhaps it could be explained from her vantage point that she is curious about him and welcomes his occasional company but does not want to get emotionally attached to him <0>
{} when he comes over to paint her house he notices the lighter and retrieves it <0>
all thats left for chabrol to wrap up the film is for him to have the butcher come face to face with the mistress he loves and for us to see if redemption through love is possible <0>
it seems that he has been exposed for the first time in his life to someone he can love but since this respectful kind of love has not fulfilled him it has instead released demons inside him <0>
of course it not clear who to blame for such horrendous crimes whether it is a father he hated or society or just something inside him that snapped <0>
that was pretty much the theme chabrol used in his first film shot years before this one le beau serge which also took place in a rural village <0>
but this time the theme is more fully developed by a director who has greatly matured <2>
{} this is chabrol at his best equal to hitchcock <2>
spinning an eerie psychological thriller whose likable characters and the nostalgic village they live in are painted with a masters elegant brushstrokes <2>
it seems films such as this one never get dated <2>
i saw it when it first came out i saw it again on video in the early s and i just recently saw it again in <0>
it gets better every time i see it <1>
this time i was better able to notice the serene landscape in the background the magnificent limestone caves and the casual manner village life went on giving this film a very natural atmosphere <2>
as a result this is a very satisfying film <2>

[17118/a]
{} this is top notch filmmaking by a director who when he is on the mark is as good as anyone in the business <2>
sthane audran is frique a wealthy woman with lesbian leanings who on a whim picks up a young attractive impoverished parisian sidewalk artist with the unusual name of why sassard <0>
she takes her to her other home in st tropez and introduces her to how the wealthy live <0>
what complicates their relationship even further is the arrival of paul trintignant a handsome and talented architect who immediately makes love with why but soon finds he has more in common with frique so the two of them become lovers <0>
paul shows a keen interest in having a bisexual menageatrois but frique is determined to keep him for herself <0>
{} the film is divided into a number of segments that ask questions about the lead characters questions they cannot readily ask about themselves <0>
{} that chabrol has the audacity to weave a story around these three diverse characters each searching for something inside them that remains a mystery to them plays well against the unmitigated sexual yearnings and need to experience sex these three have in common <1>
it is a way to look at the s that is through the lenses of these materialists who seemed to shun that periods more typical cultural revolution <1>
the womens search is a personal one it is for some kind of comfort that can take away their loneliness <0>
by all indications they could care less about art or the world <0>
why knows she is not a good artist and frique could care less <0>
pauls search remains more of a mystery as his only other interest besides these two women is the love he has for his work <0>
{} though the sex is not explicit its tenseness is what is felt as an obsession as frique and paul feel a happiness in their love that fills a void in their life that they couldnt find before <0>
why is the odd one out but cant accept her fate as she begins to transform changing her look and style so that she could become a clone for frique <0>
once she has tasted this lifestyle she cant go back to being a virgin sidewalk artist again <0>
paul being the most intuitive of the three senses a danger in the house which also has two gay robue and riais freeloading sychophants there who are nasty sorts having outlived their usefulness to frique and are asked by her unceremoniously to leave <0>
{} what makes this one of chabrols better films is the unexpected resources of the characters to pull off this emotionally draining story the females the very fragile does of the film and the male who is the hunter wrestle with the ambiguities of their sexual intentions and inclinations as it leads up to the tragic ending <1>
their emotionally desperate situation always seems to be one step beyond their reach as they get deeper and deeper into an unresolvable situation with the film ending on its bleakest note with a certain amount of vagueness still remaining that is befitting a film that has told its story with all the style and clarity it could muster <1>

[21739/d]
{} the phone rings at am in the home of advertising man chris lloyd bale and his wife marion watson and their baby girl <0>
when the phone rings that early marion says she expects bad news <0>
its and this bourgeois couple in their early s who live in the london suburb of eastwood a community once optimistically dubbed the place of the future that had plans to link this commuter railroad all over england and to the continent but all that fell through and it it is now just a typical bedroom suburban community with a train to the city <0>
a retired commuter wood will tell chris on his last commute after years that metroland is not a place but a state of mind <0>
{} the trouble on the phone turns out to be toni ross the best friend of chris and a reminder of his rebellious days as a bohemian in the s and someone marion detests for his anger and the blame he casts on others for his failure to be a recognized poet <0>
in other words she knows that he is a phony <0>
but he is chris lifelong friend someone he has lost contact with for the past years except for the occasional postcard like the one that said africas where its happening <0>
vibrant culture <0>
great people <0>
thinking of hanging out here for a while <0>
eat the rich <0>
love toni <0>
if i got a postcard like that i would think of getting a new best friend <0>
anyway that starts a rather predictable meeting with his old friend and the beginning of a clicheridden story about a midlife crisis that the restless chris is having with his decision to live in the suburbs as he is yearning for the good old days of being free from marriage and responsibilities <0>
toni upon meeting him tells him he has become like his parents <0>
{} this is a story which turns out to be so flat and without emotion and plays like a film you can almost swear you saw before even if you didnt thats how forgettable and regretable the story and the acting are <-2>
it almost makes you wonder what the filmmaker is trying to say about this trite conundrum his protaganist has <-1>
the film never comes to any surprises or reveals anything you wouldnt have known if you didnt see the film <-1>
which is why i would think the sensible thing to do for those who value how they spend their time would be to avoid this one <-1>
at least thats what i would do if i had it to do over <0>
but thats not to say that the film was so terrible that it cant be seen that would not be true since it is not so bad as it is a case of it being so dull that it negates any enjoyment value <1>
{} toni fills chris in on his life telling him that he was teaching a writing course in california and seducing his female students isnt that charming and being a worldwide traveller <0>
he is also someone who is constantly berating his friend for being bourgeois without even asking him if he is happy about his decision to go from being a freelance photographer living in paris to such a hopelessly middleclass situation here <0>
why toni is a poet we have to take as a statement of fact coming from the filmmaker because he appears like an obnoxious jerk and an actor who is badly miscast and there was no evidence given in the film that he shows even enough intelligence to spell poet let alone to even consider him to be a poet <-2>
{} the film flips back and forth between the beatlemaniaera of the early s and the suburbs of the s as it uses the means of flashback to show chris then and now as he wonders how his life would have turned out if he stayed with his upfront sexually free girlfriend in paris annick zylberstein who had no trouble fitting in with the other actors playing their parts as she also gave a zombielike performance <-1>
chris as a bohemian was too pathetic to seriously believe and not funny enough to laugh at <0>
but what was really laughable was the filmmakers bourgeois conception of what a bohemian is <-1>
{} whats left for the story to tell are those predictable scenes of the friend who is not the friend he pretends to be but someone who is jealous of his friend material comforts and satisfying marriage <0>
the task of getting all this straight for our befuddled heros handsome head is his solid wife and she will tell our hero this even if he finds it so hard to believe <0>
{} in one flashback scene i was personally annoyed to hear one of my favorite french directors robert bresson have his name being dropped by chris when he asks annick do you want to see a film <-1>
theres a new bresson playing <0>
this film will not be mistaken for a bresson <-2>
trust me on that <0>
{} the film was able to muster one great line of dialogue and it comes from marion as she tells her hapless hubby you will get married because you are not original enough not to <1>
the worst line in the movie is when chris realizes he has a good thing going with marion and tells her his reason for not fooling around with another woman who wants fastfood if you can eat at the ritz <-1>

{} if you want a brand new hard body blue nissan pickup for free you might consider entering a contest from an auto dealership in longview texas taking place every spring where contestants are chosen from a lottery <0>
in this filmed contest where there were contestants the winner of the pickup will be the last one standing upright no leaning or squatting allowed with the winner having at least one gloved hand the glove is to avoid any scratches on the truck <0>
{} the other rules of the contest include a mandatory drug test when the contest gets down to three people <0>
a second prize of and a third prize of a gift certificate at a local store to appease the contestants who have gone so far but failed <0>
there are minute breaks every hour and after hours there is a minute break <0>
{} the dealerships crude advertising gimmick seemingly exploits the bluecollar type of participants undergoing this lunacy who will go without sleep for days and will battle exhaustion the heat and the mosquitoes <0>
this makes for a different type of documentary one with a less serious tone than most others but one that is fun to watch as the varied contestants of different ages sizes genders and races each have their idea on what it takes for them to win <0>
the thing they have most in common is that they want the truck the question is how much do they want it <0>
{} a previous winner the cowboy sage benny perkins who went for some hours without sleep to win his truck two years ago offers his view on what it takes to win this endurance test in an interview shot before the contest began and was shown throughout the contest of which he was again an entrant and was considered the favorite because of his previous experience <0>
he contends that it is mental toughness that is required and maturity and knowing how to get comfotable and eat light food during the breaks <0>
he doubts if anyone under will win unless he is a former marine with that disciplined mindset <0>
he calls this event a human drama thing rather than a contest <0>
{} bindlers camera crew was there night and day to chronicle the event along with voluntary judges and family and friends cheering on the contestants as the documentary became about why and how the participants entered the contest and why they are still in it <0>
bindler is a native of that texas city though the yearold went away to study at new york university film school but returned to film the event he recalled as something he thought was absurd but didnt know what else to make of it <0>
{} some of the contestants who were singled out for interviews were the ones whose personalities stood out whom we saw at different hours and in different frames of mood and in alternating physical conditions <0>
{} norma is an obese hispanic woman who is a fervant christian <0>
she believes god wants her to win the truck and she has a prayer group of some two hundred members from her church praying for her to win <0>
to keep alert she listens to gospel music on her radio headphones and sometimes goes into fits of joyous laughter to keep her spirits up <0>
russell welsh needs to get a truck to replace his other one after a tough year <0>
kelly mangrum is an attractive student who wants braces and will sell the truck to meet some of her other expenses <0>
greg is an exmarine who believes he has the youth and physical stamina to win <0>
janis is distinctively missing a few front teeth and says she always finishes what she starts <0>
ronald is a black country boy who says he will fast for three days but is seen eating snickers during the breaks <0>
he wishes there was no tent over his head because he loves the heat and he thinks the tent helps the others more than it does him <0>
j d drew is the oldest contestant and is an avid deer hunter who described how he stood patiently for long periods to get his prey <0>
angie learns that she didnt prepare properly for the contest and quits when she becomes disorientated saying she doesnt think she would ever do it again but she comes back next year and wins <0>
paul prince feels he is in great condition and thinks he can go the distance <0>
raul thinks he has what it takes to win and is seen getting a foot massage from his girlfriend <0>
{} what is magnanimous about the documentary was that even though it could have gone for the cheap joke and made fun of these people instead it takes them seriously and lets them explain in their own way why they are there <1>
the filmmaker clearly saw that what the contestants were doing was fantastic and out of the ordinary already so there was no need to embellish the story and by keeping it simple he succeeded in telling their story honestly and in a very human way <2>
these real people happened to also be likable people manifesting real concerns and problems and when people start dropping out you can see a camaraderie growing between some of these strangers others remain critical of their competitors <0>
but despite the competitiveness of the event most of them realize that they were all put through some ordeal and they went through it together and therefore shared the trip and learned something about human values <0>
the result is a quirky nondramatic human interest story about the need for texans to drive a pickup as if it was their god given right to have one <0>
and as benny said it is something to see people struggling to get what you want <0>
but at least they tried <0>
people dont want to take a risk anymore they are afraid that if they fail they will get hurt <0>
ill buy that <0>
its worth a look reminding me a little bit of that sydney pollack film they shoot horses dont they but without the cheap sentimentality pollack threw into his film <2>
it played for me more like a sports story that espn would air where the filmmaker didnt know who was going to win and many times focused on those who unexpectedly dropped out and part of the lure of the film was choosing who you think will win <0>

[17119/b-]
{} a cold thriller exploring the exploitation of violence by heaping up a huge quantity of exploitive violence itself to make some points about what is the publics attitude and tolerance level for the random violence that is present in society <0>
in other words this is an exploitive violent film railing against exploitive violent films if that makes sense <0>
it holds to the socalled philosophy of fighting fire with fire <0>
by crafting an intelligent screenplay and not going for the unnecessary showing of gore much of this is done offscreen which might be almost as horrific as seeing the actual mayhem the director is able to keep the film arty <-1>
but by playing with the publics prurient interest in violence as a way of life something they have been numbed into accepting as part of their television and mtv inheritance this powerful story has a chilling affect on rationality questioning the viewing habits and the responses to violence the public has <1>
{} this film is about a wealthy welleducated couple georg and anna ulrich and suzanne and their young son georg jr stefan going to their isolated luxurious lakeside summer resort home to do some boating golfing and escape from the summer heat <0>
a polite cleancut intruder peter frank comes in to borrow eggs from them for their neighbor and wont leave turning rude as his partner also cleancut paul arno soon arrives to torment the couple smacking georgs knee with a golf club so that he is disabled for the remainder of this hostage situation and is unable to properly defend his family <0>
there is also the most riveting scene in the movie where anna is forced to strip subject to possible rape while her son is blindfolded and her husband is forced to answer ridiculous questions <0>
the hostage situation is barely watchable the mental torture the couple is put through is sickening these psychologically sadistic murderers offer no true explanation for their actions using mockery and cynical responses to mask the power trip they are on <-1>
they have no redeeming human features and their cruel intent is played up for the cameras benefit paul even winks at the camera as if the audience is in on this game they are playing <0>
in one of the scenes the camera is rewound when the audience is given the gratuitous pleasure in seeing one of the sadists killed but even this is not granted to the audience when the scene is finally rewound <0>
{} what remains to be comprehended is how a family trying to survive and hold onto to their dignity can manage in the best way they can as these misfits play games with them pretending to give them choices in choosing their suffering but always telling them that they will kill them before they leave <0>
these thugs are complete fakes even their names are fictitious as they keep referring to themselves with different names such as tom and jerry beavis and butthead <0>
paul calls peter fatty several times to the mock displeasure of peter tom beavis or whoever this obese snide monster really is <0>
everything about these two is a facade their phony stories of who they are and how they were brought up their pretenses at politeness add up to zero for an audience that is left dismayed realizing that it is only their evil that is real in this film despite the directors aim to fictionalize the reality of this fictitious situation to reduce everyone to a cartoon image to make it appear that we can grow to expect violence as a natural part of life <0>
that part doesnt work as well as the director might think it does <-1>
the family is real to the audience <0>
georgs lack of courage and quiet in the face of danger leaves him distraught unable to face himself <0>
annas resolute behavior and her human foibles make us sympathize with her even more so even if we are not particularly enamored by the way she deports herself when she is in control of things and the sons confusion touches us deeply as we see him look for direction to his now helpless parents a nightmare for any parent to be in a situation where you cant protect your child <0>
{} i am left with the choice of how to rate the movie knowing full well that the sophist argument is if you dont like what you are seeing then dont see the rest of it <-1>
thats well and good <0>
and if that is your philosophy on how to how to handle exploitive material i cant condemn you for it <0>
i would think that many people of sound mind would feel this way and will walk out of the theater <-1>
but i dont think as the director thinks in an interview he gave that people who stay to see the entire movie really need the movie <-1>
i dont necessarily need this movie <-1>
i stayed to see if this sadistic film works its point of view out and i was disappointed that with all its novelty and games and pretenses to high art it offered nothing much in the way of seeing things differently <-1>
the film is successful not because of its message but because it is a wellcrafted film from a filmmaker who knows how to make films even if he pretends to be doing more than he is capable of <-1>
this film succeeds with the small share of the audience it can garner because it is surprisingly enough an entertaining film and it broaches a subject that is very difficult to understand that tweaks our interest in seeing if there is anything new to say about violence <1>
and the hope is that we might be able to understand violence a little bit better even if it has to come to us by way of an unorthodox position and that maybe since violent films are so universally popular we can somehow see the human condition on film and not be anesthetized by the reality of violence <0>
{} as far as the critical success of this film goes i think it is merely a better version of all those halloween grizzly killing pictures we are subjected to if you want a high class texas chainsaw massacre film <-1>

{} chabrol continues to make original films in his own inimical style some very successful others not quite hitting the mark <0>
this one is a theological mystery that is done in english from an ellery queen novel <0>
it is supported by a fine cast who set an eerie mood for a story that will involve adultery madness blackmail deception jealousy theology and murder <1>
its results are mixed being that it succeeds as something different from most thrillers but it is rather chaotically done <1>
at times it looks as if it were a b movie <-1>
{} perkins overthetop portrayal of the manic charles is eye catching <1>
he has sex with his fathers wife helene marlene his young stepmother <0>
this is done in the handsome style chabrol has come to be known for when he wants to raise eyebrows about the bourgeoisie <0>
charles is the adopted son of theo orson who found him on the doorsteps of his house and decided to keep him <0>
theo is an eccentrically wealthy man who owns just about everything in the village they live in <0>
in he built his excessively palatial dream mansion with rooms needing seven servants to take care of the occupants and the vast grounds <0>
{} we first come across charles in a hotel room as he awakens from a religious dream all covered with blood <0>
he suffers from memory loss of how he spent the last four days <0>
worried about this he calls his old college philosophy professor piccoli who he has not seen for years but of whom he has fond memories <0>
he invites the professor to be his guest at the mansion hoping that the professor can piece things together for him <0>
he tells of his relationship with his fathers wife shows him his studio where he has done classical greek sculptures of such deities as jupiter and he mentions that he is being blackmailed having written love letters to helene that were stolen and now are in the possession of the blackmailer <0>
{} to pay off the blackmail ransom charles steals from his fathers safe making it look like a robbery <0>
but the blackmailer calls again saying he has photostats of the original letters <0>
this time helene pawns her diamond necklace as charles has the professor do the actual pawning of it <0>
this backfires as theo discovers that the necklace is missing and reports that to the police <0>
they bring the pawnbroker to his house where he identifies the professor as the one who pawned it <0>
theo wants to know why and the professor tells him to ask his son <0>
charles gets angry with the professor for implicating him in the theft and rebuffs the professor <0>
{} the film begins to make sense if you view it from the unique theological spin it puts on the story <0>
by coincidence on the train back to paris the professor overhears a little girl talk about god and the ten commandments the film takes its title by comparing the ten days leading up to the main event in this story with the precepts found in the ten commandments <0>
the professor figures out that theo is playing god and by realizing his imperfections jealousy overcomes him <0>
thereby he cant control his urge to destroy <0>
but the professor arrives too late and a murder is committed to make it appear like a suicide with the intention of blaming all the robberies on the mentally disturbed charles <0>
{} this unique film is both awkward and mesmerizing and at all times tantalizing our sensiblities <-2>
it seems to want to question how deep our faith is in god which is a recurring theme in many chabrol films <0>
the answers are skewed as chabrol is cynical enough to believe that the rich can get away with anything including murder <0>
the professor the hero of the story walks away from all this with a clear conscience <0>
but theo remains godlike charming the public and buying them off with his wealth making sure that they are only aware of his benevolent side <0>
this is a film that might seem better the second and third time you view it than it does at first <1>

he also has some heavy gambling debts but doesnt have the money to settle up with the gangsters he owes the money to <0>

admittedly pat is attracted to her having more than a friendship in mind with the comely woman <0>
loneliness seems to be her only reason for making contact with someone she has nothing in common with <0>
into the mix of this new friendship you can add the busty nightclub singer at judiths favorite nightspot liz bailey queen latifah <0>
she becomes her provider of wisdom <0>
though she is also divorced and admittedly is no crackerjack in dealing with relationships yet she seems to be handling her divorce in a more worldly manner than her new friends <0>
{} as you might surmise from a mainstream film like this it wants to pull you along with all the heartaches it can muster from these lonely souls and it does so by making use of semi flashbacks and scenes that have a mixture of fantasy and reality to it <2>
we continually hear judiths bitter thoughts pour out from her as she tries to get another life for herself <1>
to a lesser degree this style of filmmaking also works for the less complicated pat as his mental grief comes pouring out in spurts <1>
his thoughts are geared to getting all he can out of life as he tries desperately to just be himself needing only a little help from family to secure a business and get over his gambling debts <0>
{} the films title living out loud is deliberately misleading as it should really be retitled as fantasizing out loud <0>
the problem for these two is that they never found out who they were in their marriage so when their marriages fell apart so did they <0>
in other words they are not living out loud from what is on their mind they are merely fantasizing what is on their mind <0>
{} this therefore becomes a film more intrigued with selfawareness than with relationships and loses its edge as a romantic film <1>
its brightest hope is how the viewer relates to the films stars <0>
i didnt so the film just seemed to drag for me at times and it seemed manipulative to the bargain <-2>
my problem is that i didnt really care what happened to them <0>
why they were sad and lonely is a sympathetic enough story but there was just nothing served up that made me feel that this predictable story had anywhere important to go <-1>
the only innovative feature of the film which did save it from the doldrums was that we were able to go inside their heads and hear their thinking process at work <1>
the filmmaker has borrowed this guise of introspection from the pages of chekhov which works out reasonably well on film though it is still better served as a device for the reader of books <1>
{} at least the film never turns to mush as its static atmosphere is enhanced mostly by some of the lively nightclub scenes such as when liz is belting out her sultry jazz numbers and offering good cheer for advice trust me it wasnt on a par to the biblical solomons advice <-1>
she mops up the screen with her bosomy and glittering presence and dwarfs the other costars when onscreen together <0>
{} fortunately the story itself was somewhat believable of the need for the two loners to use each other in a nice way to find a path in their life to take them out of their doldrums and to find out who they are <1>
but i couldnt picture them falling in love for even a second and certainly not for a minute these two were just not compatable <0>
she being cultured and upperclass and aspiring to be a pediatrician and pat who is unappealing to her physically and is a coarse uneducated man and he is a dullard <0>
but come to think of it shes pretty dull herself <0>
{} on a positive note the selfpity of the two is handled deftly by the director and the releases the two find for their tension are very human vices to have his being gambling and hers drinking too many dry martinis and talking aloud to herself fantasizing <1>
{} the pathetic nature of how their lives have turned out and of how far down they have sunk comes across in moments such as when judith mistakes the wrong door for the bathroom in a nightclub and is suddenly pounced on by a man kissing her passionately elias koteas <0>
that he turns out to have made a mistake expecting a married woman at the bar to join him for the kiss doesnt deter her from not only forgiving him for the mistake but becoming attracted to him especially when she finds him to be harmless and civil <0>
needless to say her fantasies sustain her while she is trying to get a grip on her life but one cant live by fantasy alone <0>
or can they <0>
the fantasy she has of making it with the hunk masseur cibrian who gives her the sex massage she dreams of are the kind of private thoughts that perhaps more people have than what is commonly thought but this is certainly not a way to selfdiscovery and a way out of her situation though it seems to help her in someway but the film has really not made it clear how she was helped <0>
her other big selfdiscovery about herself comes when she acts out a fantasy at a lesbian afterhours nightclub <0>
this becomes another bridge taken between reality and fantasy and it was the most spirited moment of the film as she lived out her white woman fantasy to become a black queen for the night dancing away as if she had been a lesbian all her life <0>
she will even fantasize for a moment about loving pat but the filmmaker has the good sense to keep this part of the romantic story levelheaded as her liking for him is driven only by her desperate situation and not because they are really meant for each other <0>
their relationship should turn out to be a limited and probably a temporary one like many such manhattan relationships that singles and divorcees go through when living alone in a big city <0>
{} this bittersweet romance turns out to be too dry for my taste but it is nevertheless faultlessly told and seems to be sincere in its presentation and what the heck they seem to be ok people and probably merit a tad of sympathy for their plight <0>
{} this is the first feature directed by the screenwriter lagravenese whose previous work is a mixture of some good ones some flops and some soso works the fisher king unstrung heroes a little princess the bridges of madison county the mirror has two faces beloved <0>
his attempt here to make a combination fantasy and a straight romance film has worked with mixed results <0>
i think the major fault for the films dullness lies with the costars i couldnt get aroused by holly hunters performance as intelligent as it was it was still too plain and too staid <-2>
while danny de vito who is a natural comic and is best at being featured as a secondbanana wasnt funny enough here and couldnt be taken seriously enough as a romantic suitor for holly <-1>
im not saying that he was completely miscast he did bring some depth to his characters anguished situation and believability to his role <1>
but someone else a more romantic leading man might have given the film a romantic tension to it that it desperately needed <-1>
though i realize the point of the story was that these two werent really suited for each other in the first place and that this was the odd twist to their nonromance <0>
but my point is that they could have been not suited for each other all right but not by such a wide margin as these two were <0>
it made the ending seem logical that their real need is not to fall in love with each other but to get their life in order and get an identity of their own <0>
but that was also too predictable an ending limiting the scope of the film <-1>

[17896/b]
{} it is hard to believe how fictional the truth can seem at times as it is played out in earnest for this documentary without actors or script just by those involved in the crime scene <1>
as the film goes into gross detail describing the horrific murders of the three secondgraders christopher byers steven branch michael moore found with mutilated bodies on may in a wooded area near west memphis arkansas which the locals call robin hood hills and then followingup the trial of the three teens accused of this crime whose motive was attributed to their being in a satanic cult <0>
{} crime is as american as apple pie and unfortunately bizarre murders are not that uncommon on the american landscape <0>
but when the victims are three innocent yearolds emotions naturally run high that there is a public outcry to get the killers and either execute them or give them life sentences as we look at ourselves and ask who could do such a thing and why <0>
we also want those who did it caught as soon as possible we want to see how our criminal system works from police to prosecutors to lawyers to judges and to jury <0>
for most of us we have formed an opinion on how we think it works even if we realize that statistics of arrests and convictions do not tell us the whole story <0>
it is not until we see an actual trial do we sense how delicate a system we have how in the hands of forthright honest intelligent and fairminded participants the system should work fine but if that is not so we better watch out the system can backfire on us and make us scratch our heads and wonder if it is possible for justice to work <0>
and that is what this objective documentary does as it allows us into the courtroom to see how the participants do their job <0>
{} for some reason there is a separate trial for jessie miskelly the pint sized yearold who has an iq of he speaks in a slow and deliberately awkward manner and seems less intelligent than even that low score indicates <0>
he is the one the police picked up and questioned after a month of mounting pressure against them that they have bungled the case by getting a confession out of him without a lawyer present and after he at first denied doing the crime <0>
in his flimsy confession where he does not even accurately state what has happened he goes on to implicate two other friends in the crime the meek and slightly mentally deficient jason baldwin and the more intelligent and articulate damien wayne echols who antagonizes the smalltown by being into heavy metal music his favorite group being metallica and purchasing a book he got from the library on a witches movement called wicca white magic which he says he only read about and does not practice and that he also antagonizes most citizens of the town by dressing in black which his father caustically comments even johnny cash wears black <0>
in other words these three friends who were not interested in sports and appeared to be different in temperament and attitude than the rest of the town were looked upon with hostile suspicion even before the crime <0>
{} the filmmakers spend a lot of time with jesses family and with the lawyers defending him and going over his confession which he now says is not true and all of them come to the conclusion that jesse was a frightened boy who just gave that confession to get out of the police line of questioning <0>
he supposedly has an alibi for when the murders took place but the filmmakers did not reveal what his alibi was or for that matter what the other accused boys alibis were for a reason i cannot understand <-1>
in any case there is nothing to link him to the crime except for the dubious nature of the confession <0>
there is absolutely no physical evidence of any kind at the crime scene to implicate him and his friends even though all the victims bled and one lost pints of blood while bleeding to death <0>
it is highly unlikely that jessie and his passive friends would have been able to do the crime not withstanding that they had no reason to do it and then after the crime be so thorough in covering up any evidence <0>
just seeing them and hearing their story and seeing no solid proof put forward except for innuendo and a coerced confession is not what i call a solid case against them <0>
{} jessie was found guilty and given a life sentence plus years even though in his confession he claimed not to murder any one he just held down the moore boy for the others to kill <0>
it was made apparently clear that the police and the prosecutors were not looking for any reason to exonerate these three from the crime <0>
these rational men defenders of the law were satisfied and even smug with the job they were doing <0>
the job they did frightened the heck out of me because of their unwillingness to check everything out and as much as the crime revolted me this revolted me with almost equal disdain <0>
{} we also see a hair raising bit of unexpected melodrama from john mark byers stepfather of one of the victims as he is caught on videotape recreating how he thinks the murders took place calling on god for vengeance <0>
this guy was more frightening to watch than the three accused of the crime and indeed the defense team suspected him of doing the crime but since the police refused to really question this guy seriously except the man himself did say he gave his stepson a spanking for misbehaving shortly before the crime took place <0>
later on in the case presented against the two remaining defendents who are tried together he gives a knife he has to the filmmakers who turn it over to the prosecutors who find blood traces on it with his blood and his stepsons <0>
there is no follow up to the fact that he stated there was no reason for there being blood on the knife since he never used it before <0>
but under questioning from the defense attorney he now remembers cutting himself with it <0>
this is a knife that could have very likely been used in the crime <0>
{} there is also a manager of a local fast food place who said on the late afternoon of the gruesome murder he called the police to his bojangles because there was a blackman in the womans rest room with blood all over him <0>
the police even though they were aware a bloody murder had just happened did not apprehend this man or follow this lead up in their investigation <0>
{} the trial of damian and jason is hinged on the claim that they committed the act as a ritual killing for their satanic group something that the state has absolutely no evidence on but the testimony of a mail order dr who claims to be an expert on cult groups even though the accused both deny being in any kind of group and no one can offer proof that they are in such a group <0>
they call themselves loners <0>
though damian has a girlfriend he has a baby with he is not an active participant in any gang or cult <0>
on camera she states that damian couldnt harm anyone she is confident that he couldnt have done the crime <0>
jason could hardly say a word and seems to be mortified not really aware of what is going on and appears to have no connection with anything occult except he likes to hang around with damien and listen to heavy metal music <0>
{} needless to say they are convicted of the crimes even though jessie recants his confession and refuses to cut a deal with the prosecutors for a reduced sentence to testify against his friends because he would be lying and his mother said that she would be in court to watch him to make sure he doesnt tell a lie <0>
{} damian gets the death penalty while jason gets a life sentence <0>
their sentences are now under appeal <0>
{} if ever there was to be a public outcry against how the judicial system works and the arbitrary use of the death penalty this film should give you food for thought about how unfair the judicial system can be for those who are of the poor class <1>
it was frightening for me to watch how the process works <0>
there is no outcry from the community about injustice and even if this case is the exception to the way the courts operate that most cases are handled with more of a search for justice and with less of a rush to judgment which i sincerely doubt <0>
this compelling documentary leaves me perplexed not only in my questioning of the verdict but the whole process itself and wondering if our system is so flawed that it would really be damaging to impose a death penalty sentence on anyone realizing how political all verdicts appear to be <1>

{} another tarantino look alike indie filmed in thirteen days for and it sure gets its moneys worth for the effort <1>
the filmmaker has come up with a crimethriller spoof done at a hyperfrenetic pace that is as good if not better than most hollywood highbudget action films of this type <2>
joe carnahan is both star and director playing a fat sleazy fasttalking usedcar salesman named sid french whose partner in the bob sids auto emporium is almost as sleazy as he is but who is more practicalminded bob melba leis <0>
faced with an eviction notice their car lot located in the hinterlands of needles california have only unsellable gas guzzling cars on their lot and the boys are getting desperate to get their hands on some sellable cars <0>
{} the opening scene is a contemptuous look at the salesman trying to hustle their customers <0>
their routine runs through every bit of disdain they have for their customers and the integrity of their profession <0>
but it went on for too long and the fun subsided and soon became grating just like a bad commercial <-1>
{} but the quick pace of the film kept things moving briskly and their use of quirky titled chapters to each little skit kept the level of juvenile humor this film was imbued with at a bearable level <1>
one such chapter was titled coldblooded hotheads just to give you an idea at what the film was driving at <0>
{} their former boss and now competitor danny woo harlan whom they absolutely despise asks the boys to do him a favor the irs is doing an audit on his business and would they say nice things about him to their investigators and he will return the favor with a favor <0>
the boys agree after badmouthing him to each other and telling about all the crooked things he has done <0>
as they recall working for woo they remember him telling them that he doesnt hire salesman he hires hit men <0>
but they are envious of the big dealership he runs and the divorced bob is envious of how woo dotes on his crippled wife in such a loving manner sadly thinking of his divorce <0>
{} meanwhile they press their car broker to get them cars other than gremlins and pintos to sell and he comes by their lot with an offer that they cant refuse but are very suspicious of <0>
its a vintage pontiac le mans burgundy convertible that will soon be dropped off to them and they will be paid if they allow it to sit on the lot for two days without trying to sell it or even touch it <0>
they are told the trunk is wired to explode if they open it and there will be surveillance people watching them at all times armed with shotguns to kill them if they try to weasel out of the deal <0>
{} the car has a history to it as the fbi is aware that a driver of that car was killed by car jackers and they suspect a drug smuggling operation going on that is connected with the stolen car and with the recent deaths of a tribe of indians in ecuador where the car was spotted <0>
also butchered bodies are turning up on the road and in a garbage dump that have a connection to the stolen car <0>
{} sid talks his partner into extorting ransom for the car from the ones phoning them <0>
believing they are being setup as they manage to get away from the redneck shooting at them they drive the car to a mechanic they know and have him inspect it <0>
he tells them they are riding in a car with nitroglycerine in it and that there is blood dripping from the trunk but those details cant stop them from going to the meeting place where they arranged to collect their money <0>
{} the film comes to its slick ending after the last rendezvous point is arranged with the ponytailed blond psycho killer hugh mcchord who is the main hit man for the big boss <0>
a number of preposterous twists come about as the film winds its way to its final payoff where we see suitcases filled with money being exchanged cocaine lined up in the trunk in plastic baggies all sorts of highpowered guns exhibited and mysterious packets of blood <-1>
the immoral main characters end up talking about what is right and wrong with themselves and the world they live in which adds a nice touch of absurdity to the already absurd story <-1>
{} the film had energy a ready made metaphor in the pontiac and the usedcar lot a semiplausible plot some promise in the filmmakers ability to tell a story some choppy dialogue that could be amusing at times and enough nerve from the actors who at times improvised and got by with it as it looked better than a film school film which is what it most reminded me of <2>
it was not innovative enough to be a superior work it needlessly displayed too much homage to other contemporary indies to make this film seem special <-1>
yet it was engaging and at times very funny <2>

{} we have to wait until the near end of this love triangle a bleak drama about lowlife angst to hear the words of the cole porter tune of which this film takes its title from spoken by eddie sean to joey travolta she doesnt love you she doesnt love me shes delovely <0>
but even these words dont make sense as we find out soon afterwards that their wife definetly loves one of them more than the other <0>
maureen robin is the exwife of eddie and the current wife of joey <0>
she is also the reallife wife of sean <0>
{} maureen and eddie are a couple who love each other madly but have many problems such as booze drugs and eddies habit of disappearing from timetotime <0>
during one of these disappearing acts the pregnant maureen is savagely beaten up and probably raped by her neighbor kiefer gandolfini but when eddie returns she is afraid to tell him this fearing he will kill the neighbor <0>
so when she lies to him and tells him the marks on her face are from a fall he doesnt believe her and goes into a rage forcing her to call ems <0>
but this backfires and eddie shoots one of the attendants as a result he is sent away to the mental house for years <0>
when he gets out his wife who never visited him while he was institutionalized has divorced him and remarried a successful construction company owner joey who raises the yearold she had with eddie plus raising their own two daughters <0>
but she now must choose which is the one she really loves and wants to stay with <0>
{} the film wants to look like a hip independent movie even though this john cassavetess scripted work he died in directed by his son is a hollywood produced movie <0>
it ends up looking not quite like a john cassavetes independent film should look <-1>
it seems to be written as if someone thought that it would be cute to keep leaving out key parts to the story <-1>
as a result the film suffers from incohesiveness but because of the caliber of actors involved they make a cassavetes sandwich seem like it is a cassavetes sandwich even if there is not much real cassavetes in the sandwich <-1>
in other words the story just wasnt there it didnt seem to be original and this from a script by the real mccoy of indie films is astonishing to say the least even the ending of the film feels like a blatant rip off of the graduate <-1>
{} the film however managed to be entertaining <1>
it just mostly lacked insight into what these characters were about <-1>
nothing was resolved or could be fully understood <-1>
for example it made no sense to think that eddie was well enough to be let free from the institution and still didnt know that he was there for a decade not for three months <-1>
too many other things about the movie were either murky or didnt add up unless you are willing to except anything goes as a satisfactory story line when it comes to dealing with those who are unstable <-1>
{} what worked for me was the comic reactions by both stanton and travolta it broke the heavy barrage of emoting from the penns <1>
i also thought that gandolfini did an excellent job in his brief appearance on screen <1>
he held my attention with his mix of manic sadistic moves and cruel humor <1>
without them this film would have taken itself too serious for the untasty cassavetes sandwich it was trying to serve its too willing captives in the audience <-1>

[17108/b+]
{} a brilliant witty mock documentary of jean seberg that puts words in her mouth that she might have approved of but did not actually say these are mark rappaports words <2>
proving once again that she is being exploited though in a benevolent way by a film that rails against her exploitation <1>
she was exploited by the director who discovered this yearold in a nationwide star search for an unknown to play the juicy part in his saint joan that is the irrepressible otto preminger the charming party guest the publicity hound and the tyrannical director for women and her second husband romaine gary who poked fun at her political views and humiliated her in his films <0>
there was also the brief affair with the future star clint eastwood which meant nothing to him and everything to her and the f b i under j edgar hoover spreading malicious rumors about her falsely saying she was pregnant with a black child trying everything possible to ruin her career and life <0>
{} mary beth hurt is a perfect jean seberg looking and sounding like her exhibiting the easy way she talked reflecting her smalltown midwestern iowa roots <2>
this journal a journal that she never kept takes us through her innocent years up to her suicide in when she was and was resolved in the knowledge that she couldnt be the somebody that she wasnt <1>
{} rappaport interestingly explores the early film life of vanessa redgrave and jane fonda who started out the same time she did and were roughly the same age and were exploited as much as she was but who survived to find their own identity and stardom <0>
the difference between their success and her failure he points out is that these stars had a distinguished family name to see them through <0>
this film is as much about them as it is about her covering the film industry with the knowledge that it is called showbiz he says not showart <0>
{} her involvement with the black panthers shows that her motivation was to be of help to the downtrodden to get the kids a better education and food in their belly thinking that maybe violence was some kind of answer to the poverty and injustice she saw in the black community <0>
by this time her life had taken a downward turn she was heavily into drinking and taking drugs her judgment was certainly questionable <0>
{} preminger the egotist he was answered the critics who panned her acting ability in saint joan by giving her another starring part in one of his films realizing that they did it with such glee partly because they wanted him to fall on his face <0>
but he wouldnt admit he was wrong and immediately cast her in his next film bonjour tristesse <0>
she played the younger woman in love with an older man <0>
this is the film that the french critic and soon to be new wave cinema icon jeanlucgodard saw her in and took her to paris to play in the critically acclaimed breathless <0>
she was to appear in many films afterward but her best role might have been in a film few people saw or cared about lilith <0>
where she holds her own with such future stars and scene stealers as peter fonda and warren beatty <0>
{} this film challenges our credibility it offers a fascinating look at the world of make believe and the politics of the times telling us secrets that may or may not be true <2>
it also enlightens us that sebergs stare into the camera was basically a nono for an actor to do at that time but is now acceptable making her a trend setter <1>
in the voiceover he says that she felt the camera was stealing her soul <0>
this is a clever film immensely satisfying and enjoyable and fortunately the director casts jean in a favorable light she seems to deserve that <2>

{} what gets into the headlines determines how most of us view the world <0>
when the civil outbreak in bosnia reared its ugly head it had the unwanted task of painfully reminding the rest of the world that this troubled area was coming back to haunt the world again <0>
hatred of other ethnic groups has never gone away even in the relative calm of titos postwar yugoslavia <0>
now that ethnic war is here again with a particular vengeance as ethnic cleansing becomes a government policy pitting serbs against muslims the problem is dangerously out in the open <0>
{} in this film the first welcome to sarajevo you get to this forsaken region with burnt out buildings and visable carnage everywhere after briefly seeing the joy in the faces of a family coming out of a church from a wedding is them being suddenly startled by the shots fired by snipers as a bullet strikes the mother of the bride killing her instantly as you watch her lying on the street as reporters snap their photos from a safe distance until her body is removed by a priest and flynn woody who is a loud mouth american reporter who backs up his big talk with brave deeds making him a likable enough person among the other foreign reporters covering the war and a bit of comic relief for the audience <0>
the film will try to depict the horrors of the war on the civilian population balanced against the medias reaction to what they are covering who are only there for the story of the day but are caught in the harsh reality of the situation surrounded by constant danger they are trying to find a way to keep things in perspective for themselves to get their story while remaining sane about the madness enveloping them to do whatever they can to make some difference in the conflict even if they act somewhat glib in doing their job <0>
but there is no way for a reporter to put out of his mind that more than civilians died in this bosnian war and of the countless other human tragedies that are so numerous that most go unreported <0>
{} winterbottom focuses on the true story of a british tv reporter who grew miffed at his stations uncommitted coverage and shifted gears on them by going to an orphanage and doing a human interest story but getting so entangled with his emotions that he ends up adopting an abandoned girl living and working in the orphanage bringing her back to great britain with him by using some guile to make this illegal adoption possible <0>
stephen dillane plays henderson the british reporter who felt compassionate enough to keep his promise to the young girl to free her from the misery of her country <0>
emira nusevic plays herself with the realistic sense of danger emanating from one who actually lived through this story <1>
henderson is shown at work along with his cameraman gregg james nesbitt and his producer jane kerry fox as they compete with the rest of the media for a story and engage in untold pressures from their bosses back home <0>
goran visnjic risto is movingly portrayed as the local hired by the tv crew to do the driving and translating for them while marisa tomei nina is stereotyped as the dogooder working for a relief agency sort of a throwin role that has no depth <0>
{} since the war is precipitated at this point in history by the serbs the film has little choice but to point out that the serbs are mainly responsible for what is happening now <0>
to argue back and forth to say that atrocities are committed by everyone as it actually was during the course of this long historical conflict would not properly explain the problem that is now occuring by the genocidal practice of one side <0>
what is so forcefully happening in sarajevo even though it is on the news everyday has not caught the american peoples attention as much as you might think it would <0>
the reasons for that are manyfold but probably one of the best reasons to explain that is that the clinton adminstration was too preoccupied with domestic policies to turn its full attention on a situation it had no clear policy on and european countries also had no answers and therefore chose to safely not get involved in their own backyard affairs <0>
{} this film offers an honest portrait of the media in action as it also depicts a public that is more interested in being entertained than being informed <1>
the film makes its point by showing after a particularly disasterous slaughter caught on film it being replaced from the british front page headlines with a story about the impending separation of the duke and duchess of york <0>
it seems as if the public could care less about what is happening there <0>
so it shouldnt be all that surprising that the public also showed its indifference at the boxoffice to this heartfelt film <1>

{} a minor but most enjoyable tongueincheek hitchcockianlike spy thriller from the michael powell emeric pressburger team <1>
conrad veidt is danish captain anderson of the merchant ship helvig where he is stopped on british waters for a contraband check in and taken to a control port where he will have to wait until morning before the boat is cleared <0>
he soon discovers that his landing passes giving to him by the british have been stolen by two passengers mrs sorensen valerie hobson and mr pidgeon esmond knight which prompts anderson to row ashore in pursuit of them it will turn out that both are agents for british naval intelligence <0>
he locates them on a train bound for london but loses him and desperately clings on to her a wise choice she is very attractive <0>
in the middle of the blackout a vender is hawking gas masks and torches and the wartime atmosphere is cleverly made use of as he courts the divorced mrs sorenson despite the imminent dangers surrounding her <0>
he takes her to dine in the danish restaurant of the brother of his firstmate axel skold hay petrie and is given the royal treatment by the owner erik skold hay petrie <0>
soon the two are captured by german spies and taken for interrogation to an old nemesis of hers van dyne raymond lovell who discovers she has info about neutral ships helping the germans which are hidden on cigarette paper <0>
{} when anderson escapes being tied up he leaves her behind to make it look like they are both there and he goes back to the same restaurant and recruits the help of the staff to rescue her and capture the spies <0>
mrs sorensen then gives the real message she is carrying to her superiors and the merchant ship sails on time to denmark with everyone on board <0>
{} the brisk pace of the film and its touches of quaintness made the film seem very comically endearing inspite of the lack of any character study and the onedimensional tone of the villains <1>
the likable lovers also starred in powells the spy in black <0>
it was strange to see veidt in a romantic hero role and even though he is such a fine actor i prefer him in villain roles and wonder how much better a more romantically inclined hero would have fared in that role <-1>
{} my favorite line in the film is when veidt tells hobson why he is still not in the danish navy the smaller the ship the bigger the adventure <1>

[20538/d]
{} an uninspiring film about a muse sharon stone in hollywood helping a writer albert brooks who was stuck without a good idea for a script <-1>
this is a dull unfunny film lacking an edge to it as if the screenwriter is past his prime and maybe should take a year off to regain his touch <-2>
{} albert brooks modern romance defending your life mother latest film deals with his critique of hollywoods taste as it results in brooks turning out the same kind of film he is railing against <-1>
this sitcom film is actually worst than most sitcoms seen on tv it should have come with canned laughter <-2>
in the theater i saw it no one laughed and watching a comedy without hearing any laughs gives me a creepy feeling <-2>
the film lacked the kind of comedy expected for a satire <-1>
even if the story never took off i at least expected the film to have some snappy things to say about those who are part of the hollywood establishment and not to mirror it so closely with the hollywood scene that it cant even be considered a parody anymore <0>
i thought brooks mailed this script in <0>
all the cameo performancesrob reiner cybill shepherd martin scorsese james cameron lorenzo lamas wolfgang puck and jennifer tilly were for no avail they added nothing to the story <-2>
{} it was hard to think of brooks as a victim of hollywood when he was surrounded by so much wealth and the only thing he strove for was to become even wealthier <0>
he never asked the muse to inspire him to write a great classic only for some summer script he can sell to the studios as a blockbuster movie <0>
if he was trying for a parody which i assume he was he just didnt succeed <-1>
all he succeeded in showing was that there is some bitterness in him and that hes part of the fat cats who make up the hollywood scene too complacent to make a real satire with some bite in it <-1>
the affluent hollywood milieu of the film took away any chance but for us to see him fit right into the upscale lifestyle of those who frequent the tennis courts swimming pools and live in those mansions with guest houses <-1>
but i think the main problem with the film besides the fact that its a one idea film is how that idea was weak and never developed <-1>
the brooks character never spelled out why he was so desperate in the first place and he never showed us how good a writer he was <-1>
it was difficult to see what was his problem especially when he has a lovely wife andie macdowell whom he loves and two sweet daughters a splendid home drives a mercedes is an established hollywood writer after years in the business has good contacts there and is rich <-1>
{} i feel i must question the films intent why should i feel sorry for brooks <-1>
what is this edge that he is supposed to have lost <-1>
where is the comedy in the film <-1>
what is this nonsense about getting a live muse supposed to mean <-1>
what kind of statement is he making about creativity <-1>
should i really believe that someone would have the chutzpah to make a film about a screenwriter who lost his touch and pays for a muse so he can get that touch back and makes a film that is so flat and uninspired <-1>
is he trying to tell me that people in hollywood will believe in anything and so should i <-1>
{} the muse opens with brooks winning a humanitarian award <0>
his daughter asks him what is a humanitarian <0>
and he responds its someone whos never won the oscar <0>
and there you have the funniest line in the film and it comes right in the beginning of the film <-1>
after a meeting with a studio executive feuerstein who tells him his script is no good brooks then turns to his successful writer friend jeff bridges who suggests he contacts the same muse who helped him <0>
a muse being any one of the nine mythological greek daughters of zeus who are divine sources of inspiration but in this case it is the mentally unstable sharon stone <-1>
{} what goes for comedy in this film has to do with his whiny relationship to the muse <0>
the muse is demanding gifts from tiffanys from him and must be placed in an expensive hotel suite later on she will occupy the bedroom of his house with him forced to sleep in the guest house <0>
he also must run errands for her and cater to all her whims <0>
she in return helps him out by suggesting he go to the aquarium in long beach and find something there to use for an idea <0>
that dumbness prevails and he comes up with a lame idea for a film in which he wants to have jim carrey star in is supposed to be his way of saying that hollywood doesnt know whats good from whats crap or doesnt care <0>
his wife will also be inspired by the muse she will go successfully into the cookie business a source of some more whining comedy on his part <0>
this is i love lucy kind of humor <0>
{} that this film is about making money being tantamount in hollywood to creativity is a theme that has been often done and this film has not touched on any new ground with that concept <-1>
if you make a satire it better be funny or if it is a more serious film it should try to have a script with some characters who are profound and perceptive <-1>
to have a satire with nothing to dig into is unfortunate as brooks chose to go for his laughs by having his character be a whiner grousing about the demands of his muse the attention she gives to his wife instead of him how steven spielberg snubbed him and how cruel it is to be in hollywood if you are a creative person <-1>
this slight aim at comedy turns this film into a slight film <-1>
if you really had to see this film the only reason i could think of doing so was to see the attractive sharon stone as a muse <-1>
even though the script did not provide her with material that was funny she did show by her facial expressions and body language that she has a penchant for comedy if given a chance <1>
at least she was more lovable than any one else in the film was <1>

{} we need myths to live by says the heroine of this film estelle randy danson <0>
and somehow rappaport concocts a mythic love tale around this premise that is similar in some aspects to the orpheus and eurydice myth whereas orpheus rescued his love from hades but even though he was told by the gods not to look back or she would disappear he did look back because of his insecurities and fear that eurydice would think that he didnt care for her anymore <0>
{} the estranged relationship of the sisters estelle and lena jones is somewhat reconciled as they start living together after a long absence from one another mainly because estelle feels guilty about how she treated her sister before <0>
so she lets her live with her even though she would rather not have her there <0>
soon they find themselves in the delicate position of having gone out with the same man an extremely muted man paul kevin who forms a relationship with each of the sisters first with estelle and then by coincidence he meets lena but fails to fulfill his fantasy of having a sexual relationship with both of them at the same time <0>
{} this film is distinguished by its stylish use of opera classical painting and victorian soap opera likedramatics to get across its strange wit and rilkeanlike observations of what can be seen from life when you become a passive observer of it <1>
the observer is estelle who pictures herself as if she was the one she is seeing when she looks out at a world she feels imprisoned by <0>
{} it could be a very witty movie if you are receptive to the characters personality foibles as they mock or imitate what the reallife troubled modern heterosexuals in nyc are up to as paul acts out the part at being the tall dark silent type of macho heman who is animalistic in his attraction to both sisters estelle with her pretentious romantic soul who is endowed with beautiful breasts and her more down to earth sister who is not the romantic type but is more prosaic in her outlook toward life who is attractive but suffers from psychological problems and fits of violence <1>
{} violence somehow plays into the motifs of the story as there is talk of a serial killer on the loose in the city which prompts estelle to say she is afraid to go outside and she is afraid to stay inside <0>
she even thinks that her exhusband jack grant might be the killer since he is prone to acting peculiarly hostile at times <0>
but the killer is caught and it is not jack <0>
{} everyone in the film is a takeoff of what a real person might be like when they are going through a relationship or when encountering strangers in public places <0>
as for the later lena confronts a stalker by coming on strong to him thusly chasing him away as he absurdly tells her he should get the cops on her <0>
everyone is meant to be a cartoon character ones whom you can poke fun at especially when they take themselves seriously <0>
{} estelle provides the voiceover which underscores the striking visual scenery in the background like the starry sky wallpaper in her room that she is most comfortable with as she collects her thoughts from the diary she is writing mixing her keen observations about romance with comments such as men are attracted to women who wear a wedding band because it is like a challenge for them to conquer a married woman to her consuming jealousy and mistrust of others even those she once loved like jack paul and lena <1>
{} estelle becomes a sort of representative of all women who are bitchy wrongfully hurt in a relationship or too consumed in their fantasy world of what a guy should be like to ever form a lasting relationship <0>
the films aim is to be humorous about this <0>
even the final scene where she at lasts burns her diary similar to the women lib bra burnings can be taken both as comic or dramatic theatrics <0>
in any case this is a very unusual and original work that is sometimes slowgoing missing the mark by being too outrageous and covering far too much ground for its own good but more often than not it is right on the mark using its token males paul as an insignificant stud a servicer of the female race and jack as an untrustworthy spouse perceived as being capable of violent acts as the sisters encompass the gamut of womanly wants in a man in a most peculiar way <1>
{} this film should appeal to urban dwellers who have been in a triangular heterosexual relationship and came out of it more confused than when first entering it and to those who have a more tolerant and sophisticated attitude toward impossible relationships <1>
and as estelle so ably says after her burning ritual i need some new myths for my life the old ones dont work anymore <0>
this film is a parody of the orpheus myth and as estelle says she gave paul two chances to get her out of hell but he failed both times orpheus was given only one chance <0>
{} incidently the funniest line in the movie is reserved for paul who tells estelle i wouldnt even tell you a lie much less the truth <1>
i think that line summarizes what the movie is ultimately about <0>

{} given the context of the material for this pulp thriller it is surprising that this english speaking chabrol film set in st tropez is as diverting and suspenseful as it is <2>
credit must be given to an ingenious script and acting kudos especially for romy jean franis and pierre for making it possible for us to be fascinated with all the twists in the ever changing plot <2>
the storyline starts off simply as a case of a boorish wealthy husband louis steiger and his attractive younger wife julie romy having a bit of a row in front of julies new acquaintance her handsome neighbor jeff paolo who introduces himself as being a hack writer <0>
louis drunkenly asks his wife in front of jeff why dont we ever make love <0>
the obvious affair between julie and jeff begins as soon as louis retires for the night and with chabrol you know that is just the beginning of more mysterious things to ensue <0>
{} chabrol will go on to explore many of the themes he has used before to belittle the bourgeois lifestyle to question why sex is the most important thing in a relationship and how money is such a psychological part of ones mindset <0>
this is all done as the cheating couple decides to kill louis and dump his body in the sea so that he will never be found and julie can inherit everything and when things quiet down they will get back together <0>
{} a visiting paris police inspector and his friend the local police inspector take an interest in the case suspecting foul play never convinced of julies story that her husband is missing <0>
they come to the conclusion after much spirited conversation about the case over some hearty meals and good liquor that she is having an affair with jeff as important clues pop up like her missing earring in jeffs apartment an envelope addressed to jeff postmarked after her husband was reported missing that is found in the front seat of a crashed car over the side of the seacoast a car that julie told the police her husband loaned jeff and then there is the information they gathered from louiss doctor that louis made up the story of having a heart condition because he was ashamed of his impotency and wanted julie to think that he couldnt perform because of his bad heart <0>
the gut feeling of the police is that julie and her boyfriend killed louis and dumped his body out to sea <0>
but julies lawyer mr lal rochefort you just cant top that for a lawyers name as he goes about his lawyers business in an abrasive and madly befitting way using logic and the command of his wit to the nth degree to get his client cleared of all the circumstantial charges <0>
mr lal is a pip a pleasure to see on screen a character nonpareil played to perfection someone who despite his small part you will remember long after seeing the film <1>
{} just when you think you think you got what is happening the twists keep coming like louis coming back to julie getting sex from her on the expensive carpet just like she gave it to jeff telling her hes a new man because of them too bad they didnt have viagra then <0>
a little freudian transference is thrown into the stew as louis goes on to boast how he outfoxed the couple staying sober one night to spy on them aware of their love making and plans to do him in he thereby jumps jeff first throwing him into the deep blue sea <0>
but if you think you got where the story is going now you better get ready for a few more curve balls thrown your way because chabrol is going to town with this thriller twisting and turning at the movement of every julie sexy wiggle <1>
{} the outcome is a satisfying one though if you start to think of what occurred of relationships changing every reel of those dead not being dead you might have some doubts about the possibilities of pulling off all the switches <1>
but by having the police using their power of deduction to amusingly follow the trail as closely and as delightfully as they can it all adds punch to the pulp story so even if you are aware that there are a few turn of events that might stretch the imagination a little too much that maybe the story did get a little too cute as there are too many places where you can cast doubt that the story would hold up to further scrutiny nevertheless it is more fun to let the story pass as it is and enjoy it for what it is as jeff turns up alive and the situation must get resolved again as julie is now in a position to choose between the new louis now able to service her properly and the dashingly irresistible jeff <1>
{} what an enjoyable film this is <2>
so much is thrown into the mix if you dont like one twist in the story there is another to soon come as the coldhearted bitchy sexpot julie becomes more important to the men than the money or their state of wellbeing <1>
chabrol even gives the justice system a welldeserved scolding saying the reason for the vagaries in justice existing as it does for women is because the law was created by men for men <1>
the film begins in irony and ends in irony even though everything about the characters involved has changed <0>
even the police seem a little smarter for their effort <0>

{} truly independent filmmaker jost has completed his socalled trilogy about rural america with this film and has since moved on to self imposed exile by going to europe <0>
this extraordinary film offers a long hard look at its subject matter as the camera is held steadfast not moving for insatiably long periods of time picking up all the appropriate nuances it needs to with deliberate dispassion as it looks at an oregon lumber mill whose owner tom blair is faced with unsettling economic news about the business he has builtup and worked at for his odd years of life <1>
it focuses on this man and tries to find out who he is using him as a metaphoric symbol for america perhaps emulating emersons views as his writings are flashed on screen exhibiting some sayings from his essays on nature and america <0>
{} by seeing who this man is we get to see how he adjusts to his carefully scripted life the flyfishing he loves to do for the sport of it his easy and almost gentile manners and his very definite american persona as he is forced out of economic necessity to deal with the japanese businessmen he inherently despises and we get a picture of a rather complicated individual who has difficulty in communicating with himself and others so the closer we get to him the more we sense that there are a lot of things about him that remain unanswered <0>
the shocker about his life that is about to unfold comes after he meets a foreign stranger on the street raving about the day of atonement coming soon and how god knows all that he should pray with him but is told by him that he has no time for that as he feels uncomfortable being around this religious zealot so he fumbles around with his wad of bills and thrusts a few dollars in the preachers pockets that are not kindly received by the preacher as he quickly departs from the preachers shouts that he doesnt want his money <0>
{} our perceptions of him as a rock of gibraltor type is squelched for good as we see him come unglued in his very comfortable home as he interacts with his wife ellen mclaughlin his second wife as she confronts him with a letter from her collegeaged daughter tracy who is his daughter via his first marriage and therefore not ellens real daughter <0>
ellen insists on reading a letter addressed to her from tracy out loud accusing him of placing his hands on her private places as he responds to his wifes question all she wants to know is it true <0>
and all he can respond is that he wonders why tracy is doing this to him saying that she is probably mixed up <0>
what results is apocalyptic as the film becomes disturbingly mysterious and evasive never settling for sure who is telling the truth but destroying the family as it is <0>
this scene could also be deemed as an attack on americas soul exposing it to questions about truth and character principles that are put under the microscope as the story builds to its very tragic outcome <1>
{} this is one of josts deepest and most penetrating films it could even be argued that he has made a classical film as it forcefully and subtly tells an american story replete with unanswered questions about family life that are haunting that give the film a certain power that makes you think for a long time afterwards what is it about this country that is so raw and violent in nature that becomes a part of the peoples own nature <2>
{} one of the scenes that i found most memorable was when the camera panned the diner where tom was dining with some coworkers and all we could hear at first was the muffled conversations of the patrons as the camera meticulously panned the diner until the atmosphere of the place was fully absorbed and we returned to tom and his conversation which became clearer as this scene played out a daily experience most americans have had but has rarely been captured so exactly on film <1>
this time consuming shot is not attempted by commercial filmmakers who live in fear of losing their audience in a long nonaction shot <0>
this is one of josts strong points his willingness to explore territory others fear to go <1>
{} josts film can be justifiably criticized for a few lapses in the story line it didnt clarify more precisely but more importantly it should be praised for the poetry it brings to its story when telling about a malaise in the american culture that is difficult to come to grips with as the american landscape is perceived as so beautiful a sight to behold and the country as so wealthy a place when compared with the rest of the world as it asks <2>
but what does this mean if americans are not a happy people <0>

{} adapted from a novel by yukio mishima the school of flesh tries to get us to believe in the sexual relationship and power play between a wealthy middleaged parisian woman dominique huppert who is in the fashion business <0>
she falls madly in love with a much younger arabic lowerclass boxer bartender and bisexual hustler named quentin martinez and is willing to pay him to live with her <0>
his great sex is supposed to be the reason she loses control of herself and cant be without him and will do anything for him even as he acts nasty and repugnant and they have nothing in common that they can talk about only sharing in an animallike lust <0>
this is asking a lot to believe and though it is possible it would have been more possible to believe if quentin possessed some charm or something about him that would give us a clue that he was such a good catch because he sure couldnt act <-1>
and since he is the focal point of all the attention able to have his way with either men or women we should also have felt this electricity generated on screen instead of being forced fed by the director into believing something was happening when we couldnt see it <-1>
{} just what was supposed to be so compelling about this relationship that would make it interesting <0>
im afraid i dont have the answer since i cant find a thing about this relationship or this movie that kept me tuned into it as i tended to drift out of the story somewhere in the middle and just watched for the street scenes of paris in the background which i found to be more pleasurable viewing than the movie itself even more erotic than the unerotic love scenes between the lovers <-2>
and this is being said by a big fan of isabelle huppert who is usually quite engaging in the various roles she has played during her long career but here it is embarrassing for me to watch her vacuous performance <-2>
{} we first see dominque pick quentin up in the gay bar he is working at after several intense eye contacts where a former gay lover and employee of the fashionable gay bar where quentin works chris lindon explains to dominque as he is badly emoting his part as a queen the lure and treachery and violence of quentin <0>
but this does not stop this illconceived relationship from taking place as they spend a night together first in a power struggle to see who is boss as she takes him to a fancy restaurant which he pretends not to like and then he takes her to the arcades which she honestly detests this culminates in a night of lovemaking where sex is acclaimed as the sole keeper of the relationship in fact the sex is so good that he refuses payment for it but she insists wanting to keep him on her payroll not willing to take the chance of losing such a good catch <0>
the only problem with this is that we didnt see how good the sex was we had to take the word of the actors that it was so good as dialogue came out of their mouths that is totally forgetable or regretable or whatever but their love was not passionate or credible <-2>
{} once quentin is paid for that is his socalled debts are paid off by dominque to chris who is probably his pimp the story limply moves along as some subtext to the already lame story is introduced about wealthy friends of dominques meeting quentin through dominque and quentin marrying their spoiled daughter with her parents approval that was unconvincingly done <-2>
{} there is one line from the film that summed up how i really felt about what i was seeing when at a fashion party for dominques wealthy parisian fashion clients quentin tells her seeing all these rich people makes me want to puke <-2>
quentin must be psychic or something because he was just regurgitating what i was thinking about the characters in this film <-2>

{} this is a simple childlike nonpolitical iranian neorealism film told from the vantage point of a yearold girl aida who desires a fat goldfish in the shop which costs tomans instead of the skinny ones she has at home for the new year celebration which comes on the first day of spring <0>
goldfish for the iranian celebrants are symbols of life <0>
{} what is truly amazing about this masterly done film is how gracefully it uses real time to take you into the countdown for the new year that is marked off by repeated radio reminders <2>
meanwhile a small radius of tehran that is familiar to the girl but not really known to her is seen through her wideopen eyes as she walks home from shopping with her mother sadr <0>
she is constantly watched by her mother but is childishly curious about the shops and the group of men who hangout around the snake charmers a place she is forbidden to go to <0>
when they arrive home we are not invited inside their home as if we were intruders but we see their courtyard and we get a pretty good idea how this middleclass family lives <0>
{} her mother is upset with her because she did not follow her closely while shopping and because she cant stop talking and whining about the chubby goldfish she wants to buy begging her to give her the money to buy the goldfish <0>
at home we meet her older brother mohsen who returns from an errand for his father who is not seen because he is showering but we hear him get angry at moshen for bringing him soap instead of shampoo <0>
{} the brother thinks she is crazy to want the goldfish he tells her you can see two movies for that amount of money <0>
but she is not dissuaded and manages to bribe her brother by giving him her blue balloon and he talks his mother into giving him a toman note to purchase the fish if he brings back the change <0>
when he returns with the banknote he is surprised as aida grabs the money and rushes out to purchase the fish going against her mothers wishes to be out alone in the streets of tehran <0>
{} she remeets the snake charmers and her curiousity cant resist watching them <0>
they cheat her out of her money but she manages to get the money back from them <0>
by this time we are sucked into accepting the importance the money and goldfish has for the girl it is not unlike our christmas time desire to please our children with gifts whether or not the gifts are worth it or not they have an intrinsic value above their real worth and we feel so happy when we see the joy in their eyes when they receive their gifts <1>
the brilliance of the film is that the story that unfolds is about the little girls adventure with the shop owners and the strangers in the street she is not supposed to talk to but does and how caught up in it we get because it is so human a story it is something that is universally understood that we forget that we are talking about iran the country that we demonized our arch enemy and if the film can be criticized it is for glossing over any of the numerous wrongs in their society that could be criticized but are not <2>
though i think that might be unfair to say since the movie should be judged for its own sake and not for any outside political reasons <0>
{} she once again loses the banknote it falls down a street grating and she cant get it out <0>
thusly we meet a tailor who is arguing with a customer and from the girls anxious eyes we see how gigantic and aloof adults can be to a child especially when she cant wait to tell him about the lost money that fell down the grating but he doesnt listen to her <0>
it is interesting to see how different he can be when another adult an older woman talks to the tailor in behalf of the little girl <0>
{} the remainder of the film is about her attempt to recover the money with her brother now by her side <0>
{} finally an afghan balloon seller is recruited to help recover the banknote <0>
he helps them accomplish the task but when this is done the girl and her brother run off gleefully to their home to celebrate the new year and the busy street starts to empty out as everyone is rushing home <0>
the final shot as the film ends is of the afghan boy smiling just seconds ago now saddened alone with just one white balloon that he did not sell and we realize that this film ends with our impression of him on our minds and the little girls adventure seems to be just one little story told and now we can easily forget about her but the afghans plight his loneliness remains etched in our mind as it affects the sensiblities we have about family life and makes us reflect what it is to be a foreigner in a country where family life is so cherished and it leaves us thinking not about any of the celebrants but about what is going to happen to him how will he celebrate the new year <1>
this is a great final shot of the white balloon in the air that is not contrived or pretentious but is genuinely a heartfelt and memorable moment of the film topping off a very human film that might surprise a lot of people that it was made in modern iran <2>
{} the white balloon is a masterpiece in its simplicity and the way its tale of the human condition is so easily related without demeaning the people involved and how childhood is explored pointing out how a child tries to grow up when faced with adversity are unmatched in most hollywood films <2>
if i had to compare it to any film that i have seen i think of de sicas the bicycle thief and see some of the same values about life in both films <1>

{} this glib talkfest is based on david rabes misanthropic play about friends caught in the web of hollywood hype <0>
what sparkles through the two hours of its production is the magnificent ensemble cast who are able to make the superficial lives they are portraying seem colorful and their story worth telling <2>
eddie sean penn is the hollow casting director who lives in a hollywood hills luxury condominium with his business partner mickey kevin spacey chazz palminteri is cast as a secondrate actor and violently unstable excon and artie shandling is their sleazy friend a big shot in a hollywood studio who acts as their respected confidante <0>
{} donna anna paquin is a vacuous teenage hitchhiker that artie brings back to their pad so that the boys could use her as a sex pet and she in return gets a free place to sleep <0>
darlene robin wright penn is the dispassionate sexual interest of mickey but the chilling lovelife of eddie <0>
after dating eddie she has sex with the suave mickey who makes a pretentiously gallant gesture of returning her to eddie saying his friendship means more to him than she does <0>
bonnie meg ryan is the goodhearted stripper who freely has sex with those she wants to one of her most inglorious moments she says is when she had fellatio in a car while her yearold daughter is in the backseat traumatized by what she sees <0>
if the movie reaches a climax of any relevance it is because of her disastrous date with phil where he loses it and throws her out of her moving car <0>
{} the opposite sex relationships are all disasterous and difficult to comprehend as the film goes overboard on dumping on all the female leads leaving no room for them to be anything but the objects of the mens failures and desires <0>
{} these four unlikable men indulge us with how they prey on the weak <0>
their constant need to talk and say nothing pursues them every moment of their day <0>
cell phone conversations and empty selfrighteous discourses trying to explain what they are about and what trouble they are in continues seamlessly from scene to scene <1>
these men are not just materialists and users of people but are truly depraved human beings <0>
{} eddie as the central figure of the story is probably the one who is the most out of it either because of his heavy cocaine sniffing or his tremendous vanity or his inability to know the difference between what is real and what is false <0>
when artie brings the sexcrazed donna for him to keep in his house as a care package he pounces on her indifferent to her as he is with everyone else he knows <0>
the only difference is that when he is with his friends he pretends to listen to them <0>
{} because of the sharp dialogue and the ability of the actors to get under the skin of their characters this morbid look at humanity seems poignant <1>
its humor is in the form of sarcasm and scorn which is a meanspirited way to look at others though mickey says he is flip not sarcastic <1>
his retorts and dry comebacks are flip humor used in the sense that we are all going under so why be that serious about life <0>
when eddie asks him what kind of friendship is this he responds an adequate one <0>
he is the one who seems to be above the fray never getting himself dirtied by the group <0>
{} the most significant relationship is between eddie and phil it was also the oddest one and the most sycophantic <0>
eddies closeness with phil is based on lies and a false sense of need one has for the other <0>
it is ruptured when eddie finally tells him with cruel honesty we need guys like you in hollywood to make the bullshit look real <0>
youre expendable <0>
you do not matter <0>
{} this is not a great drama as much as it is a black comedy that has great acting and intriguing dialogue <1>
there are no break throughs in character that can explain misfits like these guys who assume power positions and misuse the trust society has in them <-1>
dominance and establishing their place in the pecking order is what motivates them <0>
they compete against each other because of their jealousy and hatred of the other <0>
even a long lasting relationship between eddie and phil cant be viewed as necessarily a sincere one <0>
mickey tries to tell eddie this when he mentions how cold his relationship with phil is <0>
phil is very safe because no matter how far you manage to fall phil will be lower <0>
{} as an interesting gesture to the media age of the s drazen uses the tv images we view from the channelchanging eddie showing how meaningless and bland everything seems on the screen tragedies wars and football games are all manufactured as significant events by the media but all meld into insignificance in ones daily life with no followup search for the truth in these stories taking place <0>
this is analagous to the lives of the malebonding friends who make small gains upon seeing something about themselves reported by others but fail to search inward to see what they really are all about <0>
{} this was a tough film to like and an even tougher film to hate <0>
its appeal is hypnotic in the sense that we are overhearing conversations we shouldnt be hearing but we cant stop listening to them <-1>
if we met these types in our personal lives more than likely we couldnt stand to be around them long enough to be sufficiently entertained by them <-1>
for two hours to see them on film is also too long to be around them <-1>
an to minute film honed down and made more mobile taking away some of its staginess would have suited me just fine <-1>

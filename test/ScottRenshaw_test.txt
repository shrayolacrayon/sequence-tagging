{} i have a great idea for a movie one that cant miss <>
see ive got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances <>
its about professional basketball so ill release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity <>
as for what the movie is actually aboutwell that will all sort itself out eventually <>
i figure it will be a comedy so ill throw a halfdozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with <>
maybe well put a gender spin on it see if we can get some women out to see it too <>
{} eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind <>
twister as inane as the script might have been at least required some creative technicians mission impossible overwrought plot and all at least involved genuine effort <>
eddie just sits there hawking up a formula story without any laughs and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required <>
{} whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin a new york limo driver and diehard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team <>
coach john bailey dennis farina has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas and the losses are beginning to mount <>
the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess frank langella to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team <>
the winner surprise surprise is eddie who becomes a fan favorite and eventually the actual coach <>
the knicks continue to lose but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops <>
{} incidentally the knicks eventually start winning <>
please raise your hand if that comes as a shock and i will invite you to my allnight marathon of the bad news bears major league angels in the outfield the mighty ducks the big green cool runnings and little giants <>
awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds its what they do <>
those teams usually involve kids for a very sound comedic reason its funnier when they screw up and theyre more sympathetic <>
those which dont involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles for another very sound comedic reason they generally have developed some sort of comic timing <>
eddie was cast under the misguided premise that its easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players <>
this finds nba players like greg ostertag dwayne schintzius rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players <>
{} perhaps that all didnt matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick <>
steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming dont blame me i just work here <>
perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isnt a movie its a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while <>
among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump new york mayor rudolph giulianni former new york mayor ed koch david letterman letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas <>
and those are the real jokes in eddie <>
nothing these individuals say or do is funny you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice hey its donald trump or hey its mujibur and sirajul <>
{} its difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it cant even get the cliches in a clicheridden genre script right <>
the knicks coach who is eddies antagonist early in the film reappears at the end but he isnt given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs <>
neither is frank langella and none of the athleteactors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of <>
that leaves her to do her streetwise miss thang routine but with no character no sharp lines and no help <>
{} eddie isnt just a bad movie with a formulaic premise <>
its a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy <>

{} its easy enough to adopt the headshaking perspective that the muppets just aint what they used to be <>
certainly the death of jim henson left a void in the muppet universe but its only fitting that the show has gone on <>
the muppet shows setting as an oldtime vaudeville revue wasnt just a goofy conceit it exemplified the whole muppet philosophy <>
sure the scattershot jokes and variety numbers could be groaners but they were delivered with such a pure desire to please that it almost didnt matter <>
the muppets were and continue to be entertainment from a bygone era where you rarely had to target kids exclusively because virtually all entertainment was family entertainment <>
{} muppets from space is a broad silly fairly charming piece of muppet capering based on a yearold running gag exactly what is gonzo dave goelz anyway <>
stepping away from their recent literary adaptations the muppets are cast as themselves living together in one big house <>
though they appear to be a happy feltheaded family gonzo still feels isolated by his singularity <>
a possible answer comes to him in the form of a message from his alphabet breakfast cereal leading gonzo to the conclusion that he is a refugee from an alien race <>
this development grabs the attention of government operative k edgard singer jeffrey tambor who intends to use gonzo as proof of his theory that we are not alone <>
{} the premise sets up jokes targeted at just about every aliens among us movie of the last years <>
a woman shows up with a mashed potato sculpture of gonzo a la close encounters the muppets encounter some starcameo men in black including sportsnights josh charles and wrestler hollywood hulk hogan a scene at a laboratory window recalls independence day <>
theres even a swing into the unexpected territory of the shawshank redemption as imprisoned rat rizzo steve whitmire escapes through a hole hidden behind a mice girls poster <>
sly pop culture references and slapstick carry most of the humor but theres also the simple pleasure of the company of familiar characters <>
when kermit fozzie and miss piggy lead a mission to rescue gonzo the history of those characters somehow makes every simple joke that much funnier <>
{} its also true that muppets from space has an inconsistent tone and a higherthanusual ratio of duds to chuckles <>
several cameo appearances fall flat including david arquette as a crazed scientist and f murray abraham as a dreamsequence noah <>
the use of a musical score full of s soul classics like brick house and celebration feels forced since the muppets are anything but funky <>
and as hard as the posthenson muppet gang has worked to make gonzo the new protagonist he just doesnt have the warmth and appeal of kermit whos now relegated to a sort of elder statesman role <>
muppets from space can keep you smiling <>
but it rarely hits the high points of classic anarchic muppet wit <>
{} still theres enough subtly subversive humor in muppets from space as well as enough wild sight gags to make you glad the muppets are still around <>
the films best most cultural crusaderunfriendly joke finds gonzo admitting to his pals that i guess ive always had alien tendenciesthis just seems natural to me <>
those who have fretted for years that bert and ernie were actually lovers may furrow their brows at such alternative lifestyle innuendo but its a perfect nod to the kind of unconventional family the muppets have always been <>
then again thats the kind of bond theater people often form and the muppets are nothing if not true theater people <>
okay not people exactlyjust entertainers who remind you that its a good thing for the show to go on <>

{} i cant claim that my experience with french films has been all that extensive but the limited experience i have had has lent itself to the following stereotypical image two characters sitting in a dimly lit cafe smoking cigarettes and speaking cryptically to one another in extremely muted tones <>
these films tended to deal with emotionally stunted people in an emotionally stunted manner potentially intriguing but inert if not downright soporific <>
it caused me no end of amusement to find a scene exactly like the one i just described in krzysztof kieslowskis three colors blue <>
it caused me more pleasure to discover that scene only one part of a complex and fascinating character study of grief directed with a mesmerizing grace <>
so now i wonderis it french cinema that has changed or is it me <>
{} three colors blue opens with a car crash which claims the life of renowned composer patrice de courcy and his fiveyearold daughter leaving wife julie juliette binoche as the only survivor <>
julie first considers suicide but eventually decides to sever all ties with her previous life and move into a small flat in paris <>
there she wishes nothing more than to spend the rest of her days doing nothing free of the loves and friendships she describes as traps <>
however she finds that freedom difficult as she develops a friendship with neighbor lucille charlotte very <>
when her husbands former partner olivier benoit regent goes public with his intention to complete patrices unfinished final concerto julie is forced to confront facts which might finally shake her from her reverie <>
{} from a narrative standpoint blue is not the most easily accessible of films <>
there is very little dialogure in fact very little sound of any kind even the car crash is notable for its understatement <>
only the occasional explosions of zbigniew preisners score tend to break the silence loading the music with significance <>
kieslowski chooses to allow us into julies world almost entirely through images but how arresting those images are <>
in one scene julie sits in a cafe and listens to a street musician playing one of patrices compostions kieslowski indicates how long she stays simply through the changing shadows cast by julies coffee cup <>
another scene shows julie standing in her flat as a man runs down the hall banging on doors seeking help while being chased apparently by muggers <>
its a confident but rarely showy directing job by kieslowski allowing julies story to unfold slowly and clearly <>
{} the centerpiece of blue is the performance of juliette binoche as julie and its a winner <>
while not the type of performance american film audiences are used to seeing it is nonetheless extremely effective <>
like many characters we saw in julie tries to make herself safe by placing herself in an emotional vacuum but she betrays her natural inclinations to reach out in scenes with her elderly mother and with lucille <>
at times the role might appear onenote yet there are deeper shadings <>
the early scene in which julie sleeps with olivier simply to provide him with closure to his previously unrequited love is strangely emotional <>
and her physical response to a group of young girls coming into the pool where she is swimming packs a punch <>
binoche proves herself as deserving as any actor this year of oscar consideration <>
{} where blue is likely to irritate many is in the deliberate opaquity of some of its images <>
julies reaction to the discovery of a nest of mice in her apartment never really connects nor do the images of bungee jumping <>
a scene between julie and the young man who witnessed the car crash seems repetitive relevant only for the introduction of an object which will later prove significant <>
blue proves to be very slow going at times and requires immense patience <>
however as details concerning the relationship between julie and patrice unfold such patience will be proved worthwhile <>
three colors blue is an intensely focused examination of one womans attempt at selfdeception for her own perceived good and will likely stick with me for some time <>

{} to your list of absolute cinematic oxymorons you know like pauly shore comedy or keanu reeves performance please add the following bittersweet farce <>
thats the disastrous combination served up by the love letter a film that fairly screams for a more frivolous treatment <>
the basic setup is pure farce with bookstore proprietor and recent divorcee helen macfarquahar kate capshaw of picturesque loblolly by the sea massachusetts discovering a beautifully poetic love letter between the cushions of a couch in her shop <>
both the the writer and the addressee are anonymous leading helen to wonder if it might be for her <>
her suspicions become stronger when her young summer employee johnny tom everett scott begins flirting with her little realizing that johnny has spotted the letter and believes in turn that it is from helen to him <>
{} thus begins a tale which initially appears headed towards a wild sequence of misunderstandings as helens coworker janet ellen degeneres also spies the letter and suspects it to be to her from hunky fireman george tom selleck <>
that might have been a clever breezy entertainment something considerably less labored than the mess delivered by screenwriter maria maggenti from cathleen schines novel and director peter hosun chan <>
their tale is intended i suppose to be a touching tale of a middleaged woman trying to rediscover romance a sensitively portrayed maydecember relationship mixed with the starcrossed interactions of helen and high school classmate george who it turns out has carried a torch from afar for lo these twenty years <>
we should understand the way the letter affects helen the way it closes one door in her life and opens her up to the opportunities she has missed and the opportunities still to come <>
{} if maggenti and chan had offered some characters remotely resembling threedimensional people it might even have worked <>
the love letter makes no effort whatsoever to explain johnnys interest in helen spends about thirty seconds establishing janet as little more than comic relief before creating a blinkandyoullmissit subplot regarding her jealousy of helen and wraps up with an outofleftfield relationship between two characters about whom we know virtually nothing <>
key relationships like that between helen and her absentee mother played by blythe danner materialize out of thin air and supporting characters like helens grandmother played by titanics gloria stuart serve no purpose <>
even capshaws helen the films center is an enigma <>
for a film that apparently wants you to care who ends up with whom the love letter gives you none of the tools to do so <>
its a whodunnit with no clues <>
{} somehow in the middle of this clumsy confection one genuinely interesting character appears <>
as jennifer another employee of helens who dotes on unrequitedly on johnny julianne nicholson is wonderfully sweet and achingly selfconscious <>
masking her insecurities behind her college course sociological analysis she makes for a great character in a story of how romantic happiness can be thwarted both from without and within <>
the troublie is shes the only character in the film who belongs in such a story <>
everyone else plays the kind of functional cardboard role youd expect to find in <>
well a farce about a love letter of unknown authorship changing hands indiscriminately <>
theres not a solid laugh to be found in this pretty to look at but illconceived romantic comedy except at the idea that someone thought a bittersweet farce could work <>

{} a lesson in shortterm benefit vs longterm detriment courtesy of screenwriters ron bass and terry mcmillan in the course of adapting mcmillans novel how stella got her groove back the pair make a decision which gives the first half a real kick then kicks the second half into oblivion <>
the heroine of the title is stella payne angela bassett a yearold san francisco investment banker with a gorgeous house an yearold son michael j pagan an exhusband and no man in her life <>
itching for a change of pace while her son is visiting his father stella calls up her new yorkbased best pal delilah whoopi goldberg and suggests a weeklong vacation in jamaica <>
stella expects little more than an uncomplicated island holiday but instead finds complications galore when she falls for yearold winston shakespeare taye diggs and he in turn falls for her <>
{} the significant change involves stellas companion on her jamaican adventure <>
in mcmillans novel delilah does not join stella on her trip in fact stellas lifelong best friend is nearly two years dead <>
adding delilah to the mix certainly adds some spice to the secondchance romance story line particularly with goldberg in the role <>
sure goldberg is doing little more than an extended funkysassy miss thang riff but shes always fun to watch timing her salacious or sarcastic comments impeccably <>
initially it looks like a brilliant idea to give the staid stella a freespirited foil <>
instead of the novels hyperintrospective first person narrative stella on screen offers a bit more interplay and a bit more fun <>
{} so much for the shortterm benefit <>
the problem as it turns out is that delilah is phased out of the story fairly early on leaving an energy vacuum for regina king as stellas hopelessly irresponsible sister to fill with only moderate success <>
were left with stella fussing and fretting over the age difference between her and winston and were left with a lot more questions regarding why stella does what she does <>
delilahs absence in the novel becomes part of stellas loneliness helping explain both her initial attraction to anyone who would fill the void and her doubts over how serious the relationship could possibly be <>
as talented and forceful an actor as angela bassett can be she plays stella with too much exuberant confidence <>
delilahs influence is pervasive as the relationship blossoms the bumpngrind stella we see in jamaica appears to have far too much groove still in her to need getting any of it back <>
{} the combination of unfocused motivations and little comic relief proves fatal in the films final minutes when it becomes a genuine buttnumbing ordeal <>
the story simply has nowhere left to go but around in circles theres some relationship talk a bit of romance tense moments and more relationship talk all of it surrounding a relationship with not nearly enough chemistry to be involving <>
newcomer taye diggs doing a barely serviceable jamaican accent has all the boyish charm the role needs with about a tenth of the maturebeyondhisyears wisdom it requires <>
that leaves a whole lot of grating willtheyorwontthey vacillation over a pairing that on screen doesnt make much sense <>
{} bass and mcmillan seemed to realize that the very internalized nature of how stella got her groove back required something different to work as a film <>
the big change they made had it heading in the right direction but it only emphasized how truly uncinematic the rest of the story could be <>
whoopi goldberg may chew up the lovely island scenery but at least she presents something worth holding your attention for an hour or so <>
she also makes the rest of the film look like its about a different kind of groove the runout groove <>

{} heres the good news tom arnold may never ever be allowed to make a movie again after mchales navy <>
heres the bad news everything else <>
mchale follows sgt bilko and down periscope as the best arguments yet for military downsizing trotting out the same tired cliches unorthodox heroes inept commanding officers officious little weasels getting trampled by the zany crew which havent been funny sincewell ever <>
arnold plays quinton mchale the lovable oaf of a retired naval officer who bootlegs but also donates to hospitals and poor kids so we know hes really a standup guy <>
tim curry plays his archenemy who bares his teeth so much that his dentist should get a screen credit <>
curry wants to do somethingorother involving a military satellite and its up to mchales crew to prevent it or at least wander around for a while getting into trouble until the somethingorother doesnt happen <>
if you last the whole minutes you will experience a few explosions a bar fight the visage of ernest borgnine looking as though it were already preserved in formaldehyde kids in peril pigs in peril and the criminal waste of bruce campbells eccentric talents <>
you should also get some sort of pension you may be having flashbacks of this one for years <>

{} dont be misled by advertising which suggests that the relic is some sort of sublimely spooky thriller because it is nothing of the kind <>
if you sit through the film long enough and several people at the screening i attended threw in the towel somewhere before the end of the third reel you many begin to wonder if you have stumbled through a time warp back to the early s when horror films were an excuse to play can you top this with graphic depictions of murders <>
for all its ostensibly classy trappings the relic is simply a mad slasher film with a monster instead of a maniac as relentlessly violent and unpleasant as any film in recent memory <>
{} in the relic tom sizemore plays chicago homicide detective vincent dagosta who investigates a brazilian cargo ship which drifts into lake michigan with the entire crew brutally murdered and decapitated <>
when a similar murder occurs at the museum of natural history dagosta tries to determine the connection between the two incidents <>
one possibility may be a shipment which arrives at the museum from a field anthropologist a crate containing mysterious leaves <>
when evolutionary biologist margo green penelope ann miller examines the leaves she discovers that the plant may have the contain hormones which cause extreme mutations in whatever consumes it <>
this discovery may come too late however as the museum prepares to hold a gala benefit which may end with several guests lacking much above their black ties <>
{} if you saw wes cravens current horror homagesatire scream you are acquainted with the rules of horror films if you didnt see scream you can learn most of them from the relic <>
the likelihood of any given character to die is proportional to his or her demonstrated vices so you can bank on the fact that a security guard who lights up a joint is not long for this world nor is a notable nasty like the obnoxious scientist chi moui lo who threatens to steal away dr greens research grant <>
splitting up a group is also a sure sign of carnage to come especially if one person alone is carrying a flashlight or investigating any sort of strange noise <>
you can also count on at least one startled animal to provide a gratuitous shock to the system to be followed closely by something genuinely horrifying <>
{} these elements are familiar for some bad reasons usually laziness but also for the good reason that when put to good use they can be part of a truly tense film <>
the original alien was a classic bug hunt crafted with such style by ridley scott that everything old seemed new again <>
peter hyams pretends to be interested in that kind of primal chiller but he has neither the patience nor the skill for it <>
the multiattributed script tosses personality quirks at its character hoping something might stick but only audra lindley as an acerbic coroner seems remotely human <>
more often the script resorts to exposition enhancers like the two kids who turn up to ask what millers character does for a living theres nothing like turning a screenplay into a catechism to make sure no one is confused <>
hyams who has always acted as his own cinematographer shoots everything with as little light as possible clearly under the impression that atmosphere can be manipulated with a dimmer switch meanwhile the last half of the relic is edited with a gross disregard for anything resembling building tension <>
the relic just gets louder darker and more hectic with each passing minute as hyams repeatedly confuses murky with moody <>
{} there is also something terribly dishonest about the way the relic is shot because there is virtually nothing creepy about it <>
the old slasher films of the s had no pretensions about what they were there to show the audience when someone was going to die a horrible death they turned up all the lights and showed you a horrible death <>
there are easily a dozen severed heads which roll through the minutes of the relic and people are torn apart with such regularity during the last minutes that it no longer matters how quickly the light shines on the corpse or how rapid the edit is <>
hyams finally shows his hand in a sequence where a swat team enters the museum in an attempt to rescue trapped patrons <>
the first man drops in on a rope and is promptly drawn and quartered a second man drops in after him and is separated from his head quite graphically is snipped in half below the waist <>
at that point the relic becomes a turkey shoot where so many anonymous individuals are killed that the survival of the two main protagonists doesnt matter <>
the relic is an ugly and stupid film which is bad enough <>
it also proves to be a terribly dehumanizing one <>
special effects wizard stan winston might have created a nifty creature to trot out for the climax but for all it mattered to the story hyams might as well have saved the budget and used a guy in a hockey mask <>

[21287/6]
{} if the opening minutes of bringing out the dead start to look very familiar youre not alone even martin scorsese agrees with you <>
the story opens in the early s with ems paramedic frank pierce nicolas cage beginning the first of three consecutive chaotic shifts and at the end of his rope <>
his night shifts cruising the streets of new york city are filtered through red lights his voiceover narration scripted by paul schrader from joe connellys novel reveals a soul in turmoil <>
fueled only by alcohol and coffee haunted by the image of a girl he couldnt save frank is ready to snap <>
theres a correlation to taxi driver theres no doubt scorsese comments in the press notes which admission can only inspire a sarcastic no really <>
for a while you suspect the film should be called ambulance driver <>
{} scorsese ultimately takes bringing out the dead somewhere quite different which is both a blessing and a disappointment <>
much of the film is spent on the daytoday or in this case nighttonight life of the paramedics and on that level its often fascinating and brutally hilarious <>
franks three riding partners provide a variety of perspectives on the way people respond to the stresses of the occupation <>
larry john goodman remains distant focused either on his next meal or the private medical response company he plans to open some day marcus ving rhames turns emergency calls into opportunities to do a little of the lords work notably in a wonderful scene where he a resuscitation in a goth nightclub becomes an impromptu tent revival meeting tom walls tom sizemore turns into a wild animal ready to beat the hell out of his truck or a frustrating patient whichever happens to be at hand <>
even the trips into the our lady of perpetual mercy emergency room a barelycontrolled bedlam that would send even the er cast screaming for the hills pound home the nightmare of the job <>
when scorsese and cinematographer robert richardson keep their eyes trained on the kinetic frenetic world of pierce and his cohorts bringing out the dead has the darkly comic vibe of mash providing entertaining if occasionally unnerving insight into a violent world where the only sane response is to go a little insane <>
{} there is however a backbone to this story if not an exceptionally strong one <>
bringing out the dead is ultimately a redemption tale in which frank longs to escape from the feeling that every call is hopeless and that he no longer has the power to save anyone <>
much of that story focuses on his relationship with mary patricia arquette a woman whose father frank revives after a cardiac arrest <>
frank becomes obsessed with mary rescuing her from a relapse into drug use and becoming her personal liaison on her fathers condition <>
his relationship with mary should shine a narrative light into his soul yet franks personal crisis never becomes nearly as vivid as the world in which he exists <>
cage delivers a performance that is alternately wildeyed and catatonic a frustrating pastiche of previous cage roles instead of a distinct character of its own <>
the moments when frank isnt on the job when hes trying to find some semblance of peace and normalcy should be bringing out the deads emotional anchor <>
more often they leave you wondering when someones going to get back in an ambulance so the real action can continue <>
{} scorsese and schrader really miss the mark in the films final minutes when franks epiphany becomes a depressingly obvious combination of glindathegoodwitch dialogue and purifying white light <>
its all well and good that scorsese and shrader claim theyve a little mellower now and that years after taxi driver theyve opted for something a bit less bleakly pessimistic <>
the model travis bickle didnt necessarily need to be an armed sociopath but his actions still needed to draw us into the way one man deals with new yorks grim underworld <>
theres plenty of visual gusto to bringing out the dead and there are plenty of wildly entertaining episodes to keep you watching <>
its just hard not to wish for a personality half as intensely memorable as bickle to pull it all together <>
whenever franks introspections take center stage you need to keep rousing yourself to ask are you talkin to me <>

{} some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch <>
then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone in the movie has turned off their brains <>
the real mccoy is both <>
its charmless molassesslow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta where the real mccoy is set might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation <>
{} the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy kim basinger being arrested in the middle of a job <>
six years later karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight <>
she soon bumps into j t barker val kilmer a hapless wouldbe thief who idolizes karen <>
j t also has ties to jack schmidt terence stamp the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him <>
schmidt who is in cahoots with karens sleazy parole officer gailard sartain again wants karen to help him stage a robbery <>
this time he has some leverage karens kidnapped son <>
just when she thought she was out they keep pulling her back in <>
{} contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them <>
leading the list is the jack schmidt character who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins <>
there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime let alone why he would actually participate in the breakin <>
karens initial encounter with j t during a botched convenience store holdup also strains the limits of credibility <>
it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point but instead they run into each other the next day because theyre leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment <>
small world eh <>
then theres the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape and pet tigers which through the power of the laws of bad cinema must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage <>
however the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day <>
{} but the fun doesnt end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne <>
there is also the absence of a single solitary interesting character <>
karen is earnest and singleminded in her motherly devotion but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material <>
schmidt is a flaccid villain the parole officer is a complete blank and karens son and exhusband might as well be furniture <>
only kilmers j t is remotely appealing but his one potentially intriguing quality his ineptitude is never developed <>
in fact kilmer disappears during the middle of the film just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting subplot <>
{} i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast <>
various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever and some end with no reason evident why they didnt end up on the cutting room floor <>
even the reasonably clever climactic breakin falls victim to this syndrome including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts i kid you not four minutes <>
there is no tension in the scene just tedium <>
russell mulcahy highlander is a director with some style and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good but he completely stumbles in the editing room <>
{} there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that im tempted to overlook the little ones <>
like karen disarming one of schmidts henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing <>
like a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few moments later <>
{} tempted but im pretty good at resisting temptation <>

{} its too bad there couldnt have been a bit more distance between the release of the blair witch project and the making of the haunting then at least director jan de bont wouldnt have had an excuse <>
with recent history to consider it may have made a perverse economic sense to turn shirley jacksons supremely creepy story into a special effectsfilled funhouse <>
then along comes blair witch to prove that you can still rattle an audience with what might be happening rather than a computergenerated representation of what is happening <>
ironically blair witch owes a debt to the original version of the haunting in its study of the psychology of fear <>
sadly the haunting circa owes a debt to jan twister speed de bont in its study of thickheaded filmmaking <>
{} an even more bitter irony is that this version of the haunting gathers its characters for a study of the psychology of fear <>
researcher jeffrey marrow liam neeson brings together three subjects for an experiment telling them only that its a study of insomnia <>
his actual goal is to examine mounting fear and paranoia by placing his trio of volunteers in the creepy hill house a mammoth manor with a dark history <>
nell lili taylor theo catherine zetajones and luke owen wilson all soon experience strange phenomena but it is the emotionally fragile nell who experiences them most strongly <>
she comes to believe that the spirits of tormented children haunt hill house and that she must play a special role in quieting those spirits <>
{} its fairly clear from the start that the real star of the haunting is the house itself <>
de bont sprinkles the film liberally with sweeping helicopter shots of the sprawling exterior he prowls through the bending hallways and pans across cavernous great rooms he lets cinematographer caleb deschanel bathe the ornate bedrooms in muted oranges and reds <>
eugenio zanettis production design is certainly eyecatching offering more detail than one could possibly absorb in one sitting <>
but at a certain point the sprawling staginess of the house starts to work against the film <>
it begins to feel like disneys haunted mansion crossed with the winchester mystery house a tourist attraction designed more for spooky giggles than for genuine shivers <>
{} once the house fails to deliver the creepiness youre left with the treatment of the material which is literalist to the mundane extreme <>
robert wises the haunting was hardly perfect julie harris handwringing fussiness took her nell too far over the edge from the start <>
but it began from the principle that fear is about anticipation not revelation <>
de bont has no interest in any such subtleties <>
instead of making a film about the way an environment of terror is more powerful in imagination than in reality he makes a film about faces appearing in pillowcases leaping skeletons windows that turn into big staring eyeballs and living statues a la ray harryhausen <>
every bit of subtext is either turned into inyourface text claire blooms ambiguously flirtatious theo in the original becomes catherine zetajones hi im a bisexual theo or abandoned a key piece of hill house backstory about a tormented caretaker similar to nell <>
with its foundationshaking finale and monstrous apparitions this isnt a remake of the haunting its a remake of poltergeist <>
{} of course theres a place for the poltergeists of cinema <>
generally however it helps if that sort of film can tap into something primal like scary clowns or menacing trees <>
the haunting cant really be classified as a horror film because theres nothing remotely horrifying about it unless you count the inanely expository dialogue eg a character reacting to a stairway collapsing look the stairway is collapsing <>
in fact its often downright laughable sometimes intentionally owen wilsons goofball performance sometimes not a blissedout otherworldly ending that makes ghost look restrained <>
de bont has made a film from the school of quips and money shots all flash and chuckle <>
hes merely interested in showing off his bigbudget toys so everyone can see the thing that goes oogabooga <>
thats a pretty limp take on a tale of the oogaboogas inside our heads <>

through her law professorlover thomas callahan sam shepard darbys theory which comes to be known as the pelican brief is circulated in washington <>
among its implications are possible connections between the assassinations and the president robert culp and suddenly people start turning up dead <>
a frightened darby turns to gray grantham denzel washington a white house reporter investigating the assassinations and soon the two are running for their lives desperately searching for proof of their theory before they too are added to the growing body count <>
{} technically the pelican brief is just fine <>
director alan j pakula all the presidents men presumed innocent knows how to ratchet up the tension using pullback crane shots to heighten the sense of paranoia <>
james horners score works well even if it does depend overmuch on dissonant piano chords and wood block percussion <>
the problem with the pelican brief the movie is the same thing thats wrong with the pelican brief the book theres not a single interesting or original thing happening either from a story or character perspective <>
the big conspiracy at the heart of the story is both insipid and insulting to ones intelligence <>
its impossible to accept that no one considered the possibility of spacing out the assassinations or being slightly more creative than putting a bullet in the head of a man who was on a respirator <>
theres only one possible reason for such stupidity there wouldnt have been anything for a clever law student to sniff out <>
its equally ludicrous to suggest that no one else in federal law enforcement would have considered the possibilities darby shaw comes up with <>
grishams story is loaded with implausibilities and the payoff it offers for accepting them is simply not worth it <>
{} the characters in pakulas adaptation dont fare much better <>
julia roberts chose darby shaw as her first role in two years but its difficult to figure out why <>
there is not a shred of back story nothing to suggest why she pursues the assassination story nothing to make her anything but a positively bland lady in distress <>
to her credit roberts reaction to an explosion is gripping and shes thoroughly convincing at suggesting dazed trauma but dazed and traumatized is about as fara as this role goes <>
denzel washington one of the most talented and charismatic leading men around has an equally blank slate with gray grantham somehow he manages to act circles around a part where theres really nothing there <>
up and down the cast its the same story tony goldwyn is the presidents shadowy chief of staff john lithgow is washingtons skeptical editor stanley tucci is the icy killer <>
only hume cronyn in a single scene as the aging justice rosenberg has any spark <>
no one else has a thing to work with <>
{} the firm was no piece of art but at least its characters were reasonably fleshed out for the screen <>
the pelican brief asked me to sit through nearly two and a half hours of repetitive chases involving people i didnt care about <>
a third grisham adaptation the client is on its way next year <>
i suppose its too much to ask that hes learned to write an interesting story by now <>

{} sentimentalized stories of the s have become so commonplace in film that its incredibly refreshing to find one that doesnt whitewash the darker side of the happy days <>
raymond defelittas two family house is in some ways a familiar feelgood story but it gives its good feeling an unexpected edge <>
the storys protagonist is buddy visalo michael rispoli a world war ii veteran living in a predominantly italian staten island neighborhood in <>
buddy once had dreams of being a singer but those dreams were overwhelmed by his wife estelles katherine narducci desire for a normal life <>
while buddy works in a local factory he still strives for something more and jumps at the chance to purchase a rundown two story house that he and estelle can occupy upstairs while turning the downstairs into a tavern <>
unfortunately the upstairs is already occupied by jim oneary kevin conway and his pregnant wife mary kelly macdonald who are in no hurry to leave and have an obscure tenancy law on their side <>
{} for a while two family house looks like it might turn into a broad comedy with the italians and irish clashing loudly and perhaps farcically <>
then on the day buddy is prepared to throw the onearys out mary gives birth to an unexpectedly ahem darkhued child and jim abandons her <>
the somewhat guilty buddy puts mary and her child up in a nearby apartment and the two begin spending time together while estelle continues to scoff at buddys attempts at entrepreneurship <>
in fact shes scoffing at even more than that as are buddys friends in a slightly different way <>
what is ridiculous to them is the idea of anyone moving too far beyond the proscribed ethnic cultural and even geographic boundaries <>
buddys willingness to extend a hand to mary just like his desire to pursue a career dream suggests that the boundaries are a bit blurry <>
and the idea of blurry boundaries makes everyone around buddy more than slightly uncomfortable <>
{} even without its subtext two family house is a funny wellacted and tremendously appealing drama so appealing that it might even be perceived as fantastically generous to its protagonist <>
rispoli delivers a nicely nuanced performance as buddy a teddy bear of a guy trying to move forward rather than look back in bitterness at missed opportunities or failures <>
defelittas brand of nostalgia includes the recognition that most of his characters are racists they toss around slurs with the casual understanding that in their homogenous world theres us and them <>
it would be easy to interpret buddys openmindedness as anachronism but defelitta doesnt make him the good guy just because he helps the girl with the black baby nor are estelle and buddys friends obvious villains just because they use the nword <>
two family house builds its characters by building a complete understanding of the world around them <>
{} defelitta does go a bit overboard in his use of voiceover narration told by marys son from a distance of forty years and the film does drag as it moves past the minute mark <>
it occupies that treacherous middle ground between comedy and drama where a film can either feel too frivolous or not frivolous enough <>
fortunately defelitta understands how to make his film about more than its obvious premise without resorting to overlyweighty symbolism <>
culture clashes tend to be represented on screen either in strident sociology lectures or fishoutofwater yukfests <>
two family house explores melting pot growing pains in the context of a simple story about a simple man <>
its an achievement thats not nearly as simple as it looks <>

{} television has given the term situation comedy a bad name but that might be the most appropriate epithet for the snapper <>
this bright and earthy comedy from roddy doyle the commitments deals with an average irish family coping with one of lifes many little difficulties <>
theres no high concept no men in drag or mistaken identities <>
the snapper is just remarkably adept at making the mundane comic at making us laugh at real life <>
thanks largely to colm meaneys charming lead performance its just one of the most purely enjoyable comedies of <>
{} the snapper is irish slang for a baby which is exactly what barrytown dublin resident sharon curley tina kellegher is expecting <>
the one small complication twentyyearold sharon is unmarried <>
her parents dessie colm meaney and kay ruth mccabe are more than understanding but they dont understand why sharon wont reveal the fathers name <>
her reluctance becomes clearer when george burgess pat laffan a paunchy married neighbor and the father of one of sharons friends drunkenly announces that sharon was a good ride <>
sharon denies that george is the father insisting instead on a onenight stand with a spanish sailor but soon all of barrytown is abuzz with the gossip causing great consternation in the curley household <>
{} with such a simple premise execution becomes paramount and the snapper is very wellexecuted <>
director stephen frears dangerous liaisons hero keeps the comedy human by concentrating on faces and reactions a technique used most effectively during pub scenes where extreme closeups of drunken individuals emphasizes distorted perceptions <>
these are loud and boisterous characters a bit excessively so in the case of sharons cackling clique and frears allows this liveliness to permeate the film <>
without resorting to location cityscapes frears creates a rich atmosphere peopled with sparkling characters <>
{} the standout among those characters is colm meaneys dessie <>
dessie is a unique creation a loving father and husband who avoids the slew of cliches typical of irish characters and father characters in general <>
yes he enjoys his pint at the pub with the boys but hes also attuned to modern sensibilities <>
times have changed he tells sharon in one scene <>
when craig was born i was at work when you were born i was at work when lisa was born i dont know where i was <>
meaney is perfect playing a more nuanced version of the same character he played in the commitments <>
his moments with sharon are wonderfully warm even through his frustration at the embarrassment her condition has caused him particularly good is a brief lowkey scene as dessie shares with sharon his amazement at the contents of a book on sexuality <>
hes also a man who genuinely loves his wife and you never doubt for a moment that dessie and kay have been married for twentyfive years <>
its a performance unlikely to garner much attention for award nominations but its as deserving of honors as any work out there <>
{} the rest of the cast is a bit more uneven <>
ruth mccabe is equal to meaney as the acerbic mother kay playing good cop to dessies bad cop <>
tina kellegher is fine when shes toned down but when she gets fiery she gets annoying <>
even more so is fionnuala murphy as sharons best friend jackie <>
pat laffans george burgess is a small role but he does quite a lot with it making george a rather pathetic figure <>
generally the snapper is better when its not in the pub and the volume knob on the characters is turned down <>
{} some viewers may be made uncomfortable by the circumstances surrounding sharons sexual encounter but i found the story depended on those circumstances and that sharons response to her situation defined her character <>
the snapper doesnt moralize it just sets up a scenario and lets characters react <>
i found those reactions extremely funny although i needed to break out my irish toamerican profanity dictionary on more than one occasion <>
youll need to play close attention to pick up all the dialogue in the snapper but it will be well worth the effort <>

[2133/8]
{} viewers of the age of innocence will likely fall into one of two camps those who consider it a minor masterpiece and those who consider it a huge bore <>
there is something to be said for both sides <>
director martin scorsese has crafted a sumptuous and dazzling visual feast from edith whartons novel of social propriety and repressed desire <>
but one that suffers from an overlong second act and a lack of character depth <>
while still an exceptional film experience it is ultimately one which i found much more engaging intellectually than emotionally <>
{} the age of innocence is the story of newland archer daniel daylewis a lawyer in s new york and a member of the privileged class <>
he is engaged to may welland winona ryder a pleasant but oblivious girl from another prominent family <>
on the day of their engagement announcement archer is reintroduced to mays cousin ellen olenska michelle pfeiffer an unhappily married countess who has left her european husband for the support of her family in new york <>
ellen wants a divorce but the family fears a scandal and entreats archer to persuade her to drop the suit <>
as archer becomes ellens confidante he realizes that she is one of the few people who shares his distaste for the shallowness of their world <>
he falls in love with ellen and finds himself forced to choose between what he most desires and what is demanded of him by his society <>
{} the age of innocence is a tale of surfaces of a society concerned with the appearance of things rather than the reality <>
it is a world where male infidelity is tacitly accepted provided the man does not flaunt his indiscretion a world where a declined dinner invitation is a social snubbing understood by both parties but never expressly stated <>
scorsese captures this obsession with surfaces by letting his camera dwell on things rather than people calling cards watch fobs earrings and table settings all become icons of status and civility <>
meanwhile a running narration by joanne woodward calls attention to the coded meanings and ironies in every word and gesture <>
its a fascinating anthropological study highlighted by typically bravura scorsese moments including a piercingly insightful tour through one house during a formal ball <>
yet for all its virtuosity i found the age of innocence working essentially as a documentary not the forbidden love story which is at its core <>
scorsese is so good at establishing the framework that he has little time left for the characters <>
they are kept at a distance which may in part be the point but left me a bit cold <>
{} the performers are not to be held responsible for these shortcomings <>
daylewis is quite good as archer particularly in a scene with pfeiffer where he desperately struggles to find the polite vocabulary to tell her people will think shes a whore if she gets a divorce <>
he carries himself as though he is constantly on the brink of exploding but knows that it is impossible to do so <>
i had feared that pfeiffer would end up repeating her madame du tourveil from dangerous liaisons but she is too canny an actress for that <>
she invests ellen with as much as the script will allow her and then some making her a sad and slightly embittered woman who knows that being a woman means never being able to find your own happiness <>
ryder has a thankless part as may and seems almost as uncomfortable as she was in bram stokers dracula it appears to be time for her to forego period drama <>
miriam margolyes is delightful as mays eccentric and knowing granny mingott but the rest of the cast is forced to do what it can with roles which essentially function as archers obstacles they are not really characters in their own right <>
{} however the films technical credits alone make it required viewing <>
longtime scorsese collaborator thelma schoonmaker does a glorious editing job and even gets her name on a billboard in the film <>
cinematographer michael ballhaus takes some stunning and instantly memorable shots including an ocean panorama which looks like a painting <>
elmer bernsteins score is lush and evocative and the costume and production design are certain oscar nominees <>
{} the age of innocence demonstrates yet again that martin scorsese could direct dick and jane into a visual spectacle <>
its a fascinating examination of lifeless and soulless time and my attention never waned <>
but i kept finding myself oddly detached wanting to care more about whether or not archer and ellen would find happiness together but never quite able to do so <>
there is so much to admire about the age of innocence that it seems like nitpicking but im funny that way i want to be caught up in love stories <>

[2383/8]
{} i can thoroughly understand someone either loving or loathing mike leighs naked <>
on the one hand it is a rather unpleasant visceral experience with troubling images of violence against women on the other hand it is unflinching in its acidic humor and features a tourdeforce performance by david thewlis <>
yet for my money there is another level at which naked approaches brilliance <>
this film is a warning designed for the self rather than for society a startling examination of one minds response to dehumanization <>
{} naked focuses its attention on johnny david thewlis an intelligent but extremely bitter drifter from manchester who takes off for london as the film opens <>
there he looks up old girlfriend louise lesley sharp but first finds her roommate sophie katlin cartlidge <>
they get along famously perhaps a bit too famously as sophie becomes rather clinging <>
johnny spends his days wandering through london sharing his unique philosophies with characters like brian peter wight a mildmannered night watchman <>
meanwhile louise and sophie have a runin with their sadomasochistic landlord sebastian hawkes greg cruttwell who makes himself a bit too much at home <>
{} with johnny mike leigh has created a magnificent character who serves as a prophet of the apocalypse an apocalypse he describes in terms rather different from what one might expect <>
he is intensely aware that humans including himself are becoming something less than human and his commentary is filled with references to monkeys <>
as he watches brian perform his mundane job johnny notes that it could be done by a tall chimp <>
on another occasion louise asks him why are you such a bastard monkey see monkey do is his response <>
still later johnny asks sondra claire skinner louise and sophies highstrung third roommate about her experiences as a nurse is it true some babies are born with like fur all over them <>
and on and on too many instances to mention all connected to johnnys larger obsession with evolution <>
the fact is that in his own unique way johnny is a true optimist <>
when he preaches to brian about the end of humanity as we know it he is describing an event he looks forward to <>
we are not the ultimate expression of creation he realizes we are far too base <>
johnny acknowledges the animal aspect of his nature but he doesnt revel in it <>
when he speaks of our new form being like the angels he is speaking with hope and passion <>
the title of the film itself becomes an acknowledgement of our status in the universe when all the frills are stripped away were just big monkeys monkeys who seem to have stopped reaching for more <>
{} all the brilliance in the world in the writing would have counted for little withough a perfect actor for johnny and david thewlis is that actor <>
his sarcastic often bilious musings easily could have come off as smug and selfcongratulatory but thewlis pours a great deal of emotion into his lines <>
yes he believes that he is more aware than those around him but he derives no pleasure from that knowledge instead finding only disgust with it <>
thewlis is supported by several other fine performances most notable claire skinners small but memorable role as the frantic sondra only cruttwell rings false with his slimy sebastian <>
{} naked is not without its faults <>
an encounter between johnny and a young scots couple who cant seem to find one another is funny but doesnt really connect to the rest of the film <>
the sebastian character is way too much too crudely drawn to work as the representation of gilded brutishness he is meant to be <>
naked has a semblance of a narrative throughline but basically its a collection of snapshots viewed through johnnys singular lens and that collection can appear somewhat unfocused <>
but from its first jarring frames to its final shot of johnny limping down a london street it risks showing us the side of ourselves we dont like to see and hoping we wont turn away <>

[2546/8]
{} when i stepped into the theater to see clean slate i had yet to see any evidence that dana carvey might actually be capable of acting <>
in fact he seemed incapable of anything but the broadest schtick <>
his saturday night live characters were usually caricatures and the waynes world films and the horrible opportunity knocks simply regurgitated those characters <>
so it qualifies as one of the most unexpected surprises of the year that clean slate turns out to be an absolutely delightful comedy <>
as improbable as the concept might seem director mick jackson the bodyguard reins in carveys tendency towards excess and gives him a real character to work with and the chance to generate big laughs <>
{} carvey plays m l pogue a smalltime private eye with a bigtime problem <>
as the result of an explosion pogue suffers from a unique form of amnesia which causes him to wake up every morning with no memory of anything which has taken place before he fell asleep <>
that proves a hindrance professionally as he is supposed to testify against criminallyconnected businessman cornell michael gambon but cant remember his testimony <>
its also problematic personally as he seems to be involved with at least two women one of whom valeria golino is supposed to be dead <>
with every passing day pogues mystery continues and deepensuntil he finds that he cant trust anyone <>
{} clean slate is so full of unpredictable pleasures that its difficult to know where to begin <>
the greatest is probably the performance of carvey in a role analagous in many ways to bill murrays in groundhog day <>
like phil connor pogue is trapped in a cycle of repetition and confusion except that pogue is the only one who doesnt know whats going on like murray carvey gets a chance to play some low key scenes that prove he doesnt always have to be a class clown <>
he gets to play several hysterical scenes based on pogues need to improvise every encounter with his friends including james earl jones as a wheelchairbound district attorney kevin pollak as pogues jealous best friend and michael murphy as his doctor including a surprise birthday party and his eventual testimony against cornell <>
however carver is equally affecting in moments such as his reaction to discovering that he might be a father and trying desperately to remember a woman he thinks he loves <>
the nature of pogues condition inevitably limits his character development but merely watching carvey react to that situation is endlessly entertaining <>
{} but there is virtually nothing about clean slate which isnt quirky offhanded and charming <>
screenwriter robert king has filled this film with bits that come out of left field like the sequence where pogue and his mysterious client attempt to escape cornells henchmen with well aimed rocks or a couple of unexplained moments when pogue demonstrates martial arts skills or pogues dog who suffers from a lack of depth perception <>
director jackson complements the weirdness with visual throwaways like the neck brace james earl jones character wears with a hole for his tie to come through and the bandaid carvey sports through out the film <>
clean slate is that rare comedy which simply never goes exactly where you expect it to go <>
{} all this would be quite enough to recommend clean slate but it also provides a neatlyplotted little mystery <>
occasionally it feels as though king and jackson are trying to throw in a bit too much the character of pogues exwife is particularly unnecessary which sidetracks the films energy <>
however at the end of clean slate i was left without a single plausibility problem <>
{} in the hours since i saw clean slate bits and pieces have popped into my head constantly prompting spontaneous laughter and it just keeps growing on me <>
it wouldnt be surprising given carveys track record and an advertising campaign which cant do it justice to see clean slate make a quick exit from theaters <>
then again there might just be one more surprise coming <>

[18020/3]
{} at least entrapment lets you know what your in for from its opening shot a sweeping helicopter approach over water towards the new york skyline <>
its a shot that has opened many a recent film one of those showy moodsetters of which imaginationimpaired directors are so very fond <>
of course you cant expect much more from a director when hes working with imaginationimpaired writers <>
there are movies that repulse you movies that enthrall you and then there are movies that just plug away joylessly to fill a genre slot on a release schedule entrapment is one of those movies apparently made by people who have spent their entire lives locked away from the world watching other moviesand not even other good movies <>
{} the setup finds an insurance investigator named virginia gin baker catherine zetajones fascinated with the career of a legendary art thief named robert mac macdougal sean connery <>
mac has cost gins company millions so gin convinces her boss will patton to let her launch a plan to reel him in <>
posing as a thief herself gin lures mac into a partnership to steal a priceless chinese mask <>
the alliance is of course an uneasey one complicated by the distrust of macs partner and supplier thibadeaux ving rhames and the romantic feelings developing between the two duplicitous characters <>
{} its possible that entrapment could have gotten away with being just a heist thriller the elaborately choreographed breakins are decently crafted and offer at least an occasional whiff of tension <>
unfortunately the script credited to ron bass and william broyles but actually the work of several more wants to cast gin and mac as starcrossed lovers kindred spirits divided by their hidden agendas <>
its a thoroughly failed attempt since the characters are kept so enigmatic that its never possible to understand their attraction and their exchanges are so leaden that they might as well have the pages of the script on the table in front of them <>
meanwhile the pacing grows so lugubrious as gin and mac exchange loaded glances that youre likely to nod off between breakin set pieces <>
{} the other option for a viewer is to use that time to play spot the cliche <>
be sure to have your pad and pen ready from that opening helicopter shot because entrapment appears to be the product of a scriptomatic <>
from the bfollowsa dialogue exchanges she there wont be any surprises he there always are surprises to the physicsdefying disappearing acts from the ominous locationidentifying onscreen titles to the training montage the film is on autopilot from start to finish <>
thank heaven for ving rhames vaguely menacing performance and maury chaykins bizarre sidney greenstreetmeetstruman capote crime boss or there might not have been a second of entrapment worth remembering a day later <>
its designed to be swallowed without chewing <>
{} i suppose thats partially to avoid giving anyone in the audience reason to ponder the jawdropping gaps in logic <>
entrapment ends with one of those betcha didnt see that coming conclusions which frankly i didnt see coming <>
id also long ago given up caring especially when the behavior of the characters at certain points in the film makes no sense whatsoever when compared to what we eventually learn about them <>
you can only forgive that kind of lazinessdisguisedascleverness if a film has been working hard to entertain you to keep you engaged from start to finish entrapment is a film that just doesnt care <>
its a film about theft all rightof your money your time and the devices of a dozen other trite hollywood star projects <>

{} many films have traced the arc of a romantic relationship in which the two principals despite initial appearances that they are a perfect pair are destined never to be happy together <>
they have been sweet annie hall sad casablanca even sordid weeks indeed they have come in virtually every possible permutation <>
the dreamlife of angels is the first film i can recall which traces the arc of a platonic friendship in the same terms <>
sparked by two superb performances in complex roles its as affecting and involving as any tale in which the doomed couple are romantic partners instead of pals <>
{} the two pals in the dreamlife of angels meet while working at a dress factory in the french city of lille <>
isa tostin elodie bouchez is a yearold itinerant stranded without a place to stay when the friend she has coming looking for is nowhere to be found <>
marie thomas natacha gregnier is a hardedged woman living for free in the apartment of a woman and her daughter severly injured in an auto accident <>
marie invites isa to stay with her and the two kindred free spirits quickly become inseparable <>
{} the dynamic between the two central characters works from the outset only because they are so carefully beautifully drawn by erick zonca and roger bohbot <>
the punky isa and hairtrigger marie click from their first meeting two rebels without a cent who delight in taunting bouncers at a local nightclub or coming on to random men in a mall <>
their playful irreverence makes for some entertaining scenes and allows the two lead actresses to develop a believable chemistry <>
that kind of chemistry is critical to a story about a relationship if isa and marie dont seem like ideal best friends when they first get acquainted the rest of the dreamlife of angels becomes utterly irrelevant <>
{} its just as important that the appearance of an ideal pairing proves deceiving and the film works just as well revealing that truth <>
where isa is sincerely searching for someone with whom she can connect marie consistently sabotages every stable thing in her life <>
isa finds the diary of the comatose teenager whose room she is occupying and begins to visit the girl in the hospital while manufacturing a dialogue with her <>
marie meanwhile dumps the chubby but loving charly patrick mercado for the callow abusive chris gregoire colin and refuses to put forth an effort to land another job <>
though the psyches of the two women are perhaps too easily distilled into a brief discussion of their respective parentage bouchez and gregnier flesh out their roles as opposite sides of the same wounded coin <>
{} the character study of the dreamlife of angels is so strong <>
that its easier to overlook its shortcomings a drawnout prologue before the two women meet underdeveloped supporting characters and a third act which takes an unnecessarily melodramatic turn <>
zoncas minimalist direction never gets in the way of the performances but it also does little to complement them <>
in fact the story might have worked even better as a twocharacter stage play <>
thats not to take anything away from the effectiveness of those characters in the film or the skilled actresses who bring them to life <>
its a thoroughly compelling exploration of female bonding and unbonding a chick flick turned on its head <>
the disintegration of a friendship has rarely felt quite so tragic <>

{} in a lifespan of just over months the sex pistols managed to distill the entire history of rock and roll into one shortlived phenomenally influential experiment <>
there were internal disagreements and lineup changes <>
there were distractions from meddling girlfriends and drugs <>
there were legal and fiscal wranglings with a shady manager and anxious record companies <>
there were cries of outrage from adults who just didnt understand the rebellious messages of this new musical form accompanied by the certain knowledge that civilization as we knew it was about to come to an end <>
and finally there was the inevitable transformation of rebellion and singularity into its own kind of conformity <>
{} anyone at all familiar with the pistols would hope to high heaven that a filmmaker wouldnt choose to tell their story in the measured tones of hero worship <>
no such worries under the direction of julien temple who turns the filth and the fury into a multimedia sex pistols assault <>
temple frames his archival footage of the band with modern day interviews with the bands four original members vocalist john johnny rotten lydon guitarist steve jones drummer paul cook and bassist glen matlock and a post breakup interview with replacement bassist and eventual heroin casualty sid vicious <>
their voices describe a band born out of the social conditions of mids england a music of furious discontent that made the sex pistols as reviled by their critics as they were adored by their fans <>
they also tell of the factions within the band between those loyal to the pistols manager and selfdescribed creator malcolm mclaren and those who distrusted his business dealings and staged outrageousness <>
{} many of the stories told in the filth and the fury are by now the stuff of rock legend the profane appearance on an english television show the performance of god save the queen on the thames during the celebration of queen elizabeths silver anniversary jubilee the onesongandout final concert at san franciscos winterland in january <>
julien temple has already documented the sex pistols in s the great rock n roll swindle so there was the danger that the filth and the fury would feel not just like a canonization of a pioneering band but a recycled canonization <>
instead temple captures not just the energy of the pistols but their satirical sense of playfulness as well <>
that expletivefilled television interview is described as a drunken steve jones having fun at the expense of the equally drunk host jabs at progressive rock contemporaries like yes and emerson lake and palmer are accompanied by footage of stopmotion dinosaurs <>
with music animation and dozens of archival clips temple compiles a film that doesnt merely lay out a sex pistols chronology it captures the atmosphere and the attitude of anarchy in the uk <>
{} thats not to say that its instantly reliable as the definitive sex pistols story <>
swindle may have been an obvious attempt at selfcongratulation by mclaren but the filth and the fury occasionally seems just as much like an ego piece for johnny rotten <>
the presentday interviews are conducted with the band members in shadow an effective means of keeping the story in the present of s england <>
they also allow rotten in particular to set the record straight in a manner that sounds theatrically performed every time he opens his mouth <>
rotten may very well be a more reliable historian of the pistols than mclaren but when he and jones relate differing accounts of a hotel room snafu its hard not to here rottens version as a bit of overdramatization <>
make no mistake its still tremendously interesting listening to rottens perspective on the rise and fall of the band <>
its also a little hard to take when he actually begins crying over the tragic end of his friend sid vicious <>
{} thats actually a fairly minor quibble with a film as vital and generally unpretentious as the filth and the fury you dont get less pretentious than steve jones crudely honest reason for wanting to be in a band <>
while temple clearly appreciates the sex pistols as the defining force in english punk including footage of youngsters siouxsie sioux billy idol and pogues frontman shane mcgowan at concerts or singing pistols songs he also confronts the bands members dissatisfaction with how their legacy has been defined <>
rotten in particular bemoans punk being absorbed back into the mainstream with middleclass kids wearing leather the real early english punks could never have afforded <>
hes also surprisingly philosophical about the bands disintegration during its us tour <>
the sex pistols had to end when it did rotten opines but it didnt have to end how it did <>
of course he probably would be less concerned with the philosophizing than pure sensory jolt and thats something the filth and the fury provides <>
it took the sex pistols two years to distill rock and roll into every one of its basic elements <>
it takes julien temple minutes to do the same thing to the sex pistols <>
its a story with the frantic twoandahalfminute raw energy blast of a classic punk anthem <>

the premise finds sensitive jay struggling with insecure maxs request that he test samanthas fidelity by trying to seduce her leading to all sorts of wild hijinks <>
{} that is assuming you are willing to suspend your disbelief from the rafters long enough to buy the puppydog schwimmer as an irresistable sex machine or lee the abrasive banky in chasing amy as mr nice guy <>
schwimmers rendition of machismo consists of using a certain fourletter explitive around forty times while lee seems to be comfortable only when hes yelling at somebody though he can be very funny when he is yelling at somebody <>

in kissing a fool i kept waiting for the action to switch back to hunt telling the tale to a couple of annoying party guests where her unmatched reaction shots could provide all the zing the script lacked <>

i loathe joe eszterhasstyle thrillers which make me feel as though ive been had nothing that can change the whodunnit by shooting five new minutes of footage is constructed tightly enough <>
almost equally annoying are those which seem to twist and turn just for the sake of twisting and turning forcing you to engage in a twohour discussion with your fellow moviegoers just to figure out what the heck you just saw <>
malice avoids all these pitfalls <>
this is a sharp artfullyconstructed thriller a snappy entertainment that does everything i ask a film in its genre to do keep me guessing without manipulating me <>
{} andy safien bill pullman is a student dean at westerly college a picturesque new england campus plagued by a string of serial rapes <>
while following up on the latest assault andy meets dr jed hill alec baldwin a cocky new thoracic surgeon who turns out to be an old high school classmate of andys <>
andy soon invites jed to move into the house being remodeled by andy and his wife tracy nicole kidman in an attempt to defray expenses <>
tracy is nonetoopleased by jeds playboy manner an added burden to the chronic abdominal pain she is experiencing <>
however life in the safien household will soon go from bad to worse <>
andy becomes a suspect in the rapes and tracy suffers a severe medical emergency forcing jed to make a decision which will set in motion a serpentine chain of danger and deceptions <>
{} this is the point where reviewing a film like malice gets tricky <>
comment on the plot is next to impossible particularly on those few points where i felt credibility is stretched <>
all i can really say is that the script by aaron sorkin a few good men and scott frank dead again is intelligent and impressive in its plausible intricacy <>
there is an ingenious red herring crafted into the story which successfully diverts attention from other key elements <>
there were moments when i sensed the entire audience realizing the same thing at the same time <>
i saw very little of that telltale sign of a confusing mystery people leaning over to friends and spouses to ask what just happened <>
every explanation was clear and smooth if not always perfectly believable <>
{} if theres one problem with the plotheavy script its that certain character developments are shallow <>
bill pullman is very good as the pleasant everyman with a streak of jealousy but his character would have benefited from some early evidence to make his later behavior more believable <>
ditto nicole kidman who has the most challenging role <>
i found bebe neuwirth basically annoying as a police detective sporting an accent that appeared to be a mutant hybrid of boston brahmin and brooklyn italian <>
on the plus side anne bancroft has a showy bit part as a loony mentor a la robin williams in dead again apparently a scott frank trademark <>
alec baldwin is perfect as jed delivering a great speech about his god complex with utter conviction <>
baldwin should stick to roles such as this which require colossal displays of hubris <>
{} director harold becker showed his talent for atmospheric suspense in sea of love and surpasses that effort with malice <>
while never spectacularly tense malice is always gripping thanks to a methodical unfolding of the story with something important happening in almost every scene <>
becker even cleverly undercuts genre expectations particularly in an ominously underscored shot of a big dark house on a cliff overlooking crashing surf during a thunderstorm <>
the audience was in hysterics <>
this is a smart deft directing job and one that establishes becker as a name to watch for <>
{} i think i can get away with saying that you shouldnt go into malice expecting a screamoutloud suspense film <>
its more subtle than that but never less than thoroughly intriguing <>
this is a mystery for mystery lovers <>

{} i know what youre probably thinking about dance with me because its the same thing i was thinking <>
this would be nothing more than a bunch of dance sequences strung together by something that could only be called a plot if you were being particularly generous <>
even the films trailer which featured about a dozen words in two minutes contributed to the impression that dance with me wouldnt be about characters but about plastic windup dance toys masquerading as characters <>
yes the films original title shut up and dance would certainly prove prescient <>
{} ill tell you what i wasnt expecting one of the years most appealing charismatic performances <>
it comes courtesy of chayanne the puerto rican musical sensation who stars here as rafael infante a young cubano coming to houston texas on a personal mission <>
after landing a job at the studio of dance teacher john burnett kris kristofferson rafael becomes interested in one of the pros who frequents the studio ruby sinclair vanessa l williams <>
ruby is an enigma to rafael since her fierce dedication to dancing doesnt seem to be connected to any real joy <>
as rafael tries to reintroduce ruby to the pure pleasure of dance a tentative romance naturally blossoms between them <>
{} simple stuff to be sure perhaps even simplistic but dance with me sells its simplicity almost entirely on the strength of chayannes appeal <>
though its certainly helpful that hes has boyish good looks and an inviting smile his success cant be dismissed as purely hormonal <>
he has to anchor both of the films big emotional hooks tentative attempts to connect with the father he has never known and the romance with williams in spite of a language barrier which he does by acting with his face and body language as well as any young performer of the last several years <>
chayanne has that intangible something called presence something that gets you more involved in a simple story than the material probably deserves <>
{} that presence is most forceful when he hits the dance floor in an exhilarating sequence at a latin dance club <>
the sequence hinges on rafael conveying to ruby the pure joy of dance and that joy explodes from his every movement <>
as obviously choreographed as some of the spontaneous moves in the club might be its still infectious to watch when rafael seems to be having so much fun <>
he even manages to bring an unforced charm to the gene kelly dance steps he breaks into in the middle of a shower of lawn sprinklers <>
anyone who can invoke singin in the rain without inspiring gasps at the sacrilege has to be doing something right <>
{} he does so many things right in fact that the second half of dance with me seems terribly wrongheaded when the focus abruptly shifts to rubys attempts to reignite her career at a las vegas dance competition reunited with her former partner rick valenzuela playing a cartoonish macho egomaniac <>
firsttime screenwriter daryl matthews also the films choreographer makes the mistake of making rubys conflict central at a time in the narrative when theres already plenty of conflict to go around <>
director randa haines meanwhile makes the mistake of spending too much time showing us the competition itself <>
if the point was to prove how much more exciting club dancing is than regimented competitive dancing that point is made and made again for nearly half an hour including ridiculous comic relief from joan plowright as a spunky geriatric <>
the solid chemistry between williams and chayanne is lost the fatherson relationship is buried and the dancing rapidly grows tiresome <>
predictable though the story may have been at least is was energetic <>
dance with me decides to turn into a dance movie exactly when the dancing is least interesting and after the hero has made his impression <>
his charisma makes much of the film watchable until it reaches the point where much to your disappointment they make him and everyone else just shut up and dance <>

{} its about fifteen minutes into flesh and bone before you see the first speck of sunlight or hear the first note of underscore <>
in fact theres almost no movement or sound of any kind <>
its clear from the outset that writerdirector steve kloves the fabulous baker boys is going for a dark and moody feel <>
however theres moody and then theres comatose <>
flesh and bone is the perfect example of a solid story choking nearly to death on its own atmosphere <>
{} flesh and bone opens with a rural texas family taking in an apparently homeless boy for the night <>
in fact the boy is the son of a thief who has fequently pulled this con letting his dad into homes after everyone is asleep <>
this time the robbery is botched and three members of the family are slain leaving only an infant girl <>
thirty years later grownup arlis sweeney dennis quaid is eking out a living running a vending machine supply business content with a simple predictable life <>
while on a job he meets kay davies meg ryan a runaway wife jumping drunkenly out of a cake at a bachelor party <>
arlis brings kay along on his rounds and an attraction grows <>
trouble also grows when papa roy james caan reappears linked up with a slick young grifter gwyneth paltrow <>
despite every attempt to distance himself from his past arlis finds himself drawn into his fathers obsession with tying up loose ends <>
{} at the heart of flesh and bone is an intriguing character in an intriguing premise <>
arlis sweeney is a man desperately trying to convince himself that hes not like his father trying to live out his days meekly as a personal penance for whatever crimes he might have been party to <>
he feels completely unworthy of the tootrusting kay giving their relationship a nice dynamic <>
unfortunately dennis quaid is playing arlis <>
as charming as he can be quaid simply doesnt have the dramatic range necessary to dig into this complicated character when he should be looking introspective and guiltridden he just looks stiff <>
i was left imagining a jeff bridges in the role and what might have been given a more versatile actor <>
{} other aspects of the performances also left me unsatisfied <>
meg ryan has the light touch required for the films few moments of humor but she doesnt quite strike the balance of strength and accumulated pain required for this role <>
james caan has a surprisingly small part given his prominence in the advertising campaign and never quite hits his stride <>
his performance is too mannered full of odd jaw movements and rolled eyes <>
its a major drawback because caans roy is supposed to be flesh and bones living manifestation of evil and hes nowhere near threatening enough <>
surprisingly the best performance is turned in by gwyneth paltrow as the savvy gennie but its hard to figure what purpose her character serves other than perhaps to remind arlis of what he could be <>
{} for all the problems with the acting its another issue entirely that proves to be flesh and bones ultimate undoing its positively snoreinducing <>
at two hours and ten minutes its at least twenty minutes too long <>
the second act is interminable chock full of scenes best left on the cutting room floor like kays confrontation with her husband apparently a refugee from thelma and louise <>
there were establishing shots which lasted twice as long as necessary and meaningful pauses which werent very meaningful <>
to make matters worse there were two minute stretches of dialogue between caan and quaid which were practically indecipherable im not sure whether to blame the sound mixing or the theater for that one <>
in live theater there is an expression tighten it up what flesh and bone needed was a good tightening up <>
{} the tone that flesh and bone is going for is fully achieved <>
the west texas locations are expertly captured by cinematographer phillippe rousselot and the spare score by thomas newman has a nice edgy feel <>
everything is working towards a grim tension and it succeeds but tension requires release and its there that flesh and bone doesnt deliver <>
thanks to an illconceived ad campaign one of the films key plot points is given away in the trailers blowing one of those release points for anyone who has seen them <>
there is a great deal of craft to the broad strokes of flesh and bone <>
however in this tale of evil the devil is truly in the lack of details <>

[2501/8]
{} it was considered something of an upset when the academy award for foreign language film went to spains belle epoque but in retrospect it really shouldnt have been <>
the category has recently favored safe small entertainments over big political epics as evidenced by the victory for mediterraneo <>
belle epoque bears more than a passing resemblance to that former winner its a sunny sensual comedy with all the makings of a crossover success <>
although it features no real story to speak of and some clownish characters its frisky tone and clever direction by fernando trueba make it a worthwhile experience <>
{} belle epoque takes place in spain where a republican revolution has challenged the monarchy and the catholic church <>
fernando jorge sanz a member of the kings army with republican sentiments has deserted into the spanish country side <>
he meets manolo fernando fernan gomez a freethinking artist and political simpatico who offers to take fernando in for the night <>
however fernandos arrival coincides with a visit from manolos four daughters serious widow clara miriam diazaroca mannish violeta ariadna gil lusty rocio maribel verdu and innocent luz penelope cruz <>
fernando ends up staying just a bit longer than planned switching affections between the sisters as fast as he changes beds while the political drama plays out in the background <>
{} comedy is probably the hardest cinematic genre to translate from foreign language films so it is high praise indeed to note that belle epoque had the audience where i saw the film laughing hard and often <>
the subtitling is superb losing only minor idioms in the translation <>
those more familiar with spanish history and culture might be quicker to figure out what a carlist is or the humor behind the parish priests affinity for philosopher miguel de unamuno but far more of the fun in belle epoque transcends particulars of culture <>
there are delightful moments of physical comedy most notably violetas genderbending seduction of fernando while both are in costume at a carnival <>
another highlight is the arrival of manolos opera singer wife and her jealous manager accompanied by a window serenade <>
the humor is almost entirely accessible and its very winning <>
{} much of belle epoques earthy charm comes from the slightly anachronistic ifitfeelsgooddoit attitude of many of the principal characters <>
this is not as one might expect some leering variation on the old traveling salesmanfarmers daughters story manolos response to fernandos revelation of his tryst with violeta is delightfully unexpected <>
director trueba uses the backdrop of the republican revolution to highlight a shift away from the rigidly catholic spain to a more liberal era a transition emphasized in wonderful scenes involving rocios uptight fiance juanito and his domineering mother <>
juanito is so deeply rooted in catholicism that when he rebels against his mother he goes to the local church believing there is some ceremony involved in renouncing the faith <>
{} however belle epoque makes no pretense to being about anything and it is in that respect that the film commits its few errors <>
there is really no plot just a series of amusing encounters which dont serve to develop any of the characters <>
the characterizations are somewhat weak particularly that of fernando whose seminarian background professed agnosticism and unabashed romanticism are never successfully linked <>
clara luz and rocio are too sketchy and juanito is simply a buffoon <>
there are two strong performances from ariadna gil as violeta and fernando fernan gomez as manolo and it is no coincidence that they are also the most fully developed characters <>
still belle epoque does what trueba intends for it to do which is to entertain and amuse <>
it may not have been my choice for an oscar but there could have been far worse choices <>

[22729/4]
{} late in holy smoke jane campions latest attempt at gender provocateurship the principal male character refers to the principal female character as a manhater <>
the principal female character then responds that he calls her a manhater just because i criticize you <>
i would never be so crude as to suggest that campion is a manhater but its hard to not to wonder what testosteronesoaked demons haunt her <>
its one thing to ask pointed questions about genderbased power dynamics its quite another to ask those questions using such weighty symbolism that its hard not to laugh out loud at the raving significancemongering of it all <>
{} campions painfully strident stylings get a workout in holy smoke a film that gets sillier and less insightful the longer i think about it <>
kate winslet stars as ruth a young woman from sydney who begins following a charismatic guru while travelling in india with a friend <>
concerned that ruth has been taken in by a cult ruths family hires one of the worlds most successful exit counselors p j walters harvey keitel to bring her around again <>
after luring ruth back to australia under false pretenses the family leaves her in an isolated cabin with walters for three days where he expects to break her down and build her up again <>
but things dont work out quite so simply leaving both parties searching for their roles in their strange relationship <>
{} for a little while it almost seems that campion is on to something <>
the opening montage in which campion sets up ruths introduction to babas teachings is an energetic sequence set to neil diamonds holly holy <>
better still are the scenes of ruths mother julie hamilton visiting ruth in india her anxieties betraying the fact that she may be most concerned about her daughter falling in with darkskinned people <>
by mixing in the racist element with the sexist elements of her story campion promises a film that could have been a fairly complex examination of exerting power and manifesting fear of otherness <>
{} dont expect anything quite so measured <>
from that provocative beginning holy smoke quickly disintegrates into a sluggish ribkicking polemic <>
walters is introduced with little room for misinterpretation as a preening and selfimportant sort who slicks back his dyed hair receives oral gratification from ruths ditzy sisterinlaw sophie lee and prepares for his meetings with ruth with breath spray <>
ruth meanwhile is a free spirit whose earth mother dance to you oughtta know provides all the urfemme credentials you could want <>
campion seems little concerned with exploring the side of ruth that quickly transfers her devotion from baba to walters <>
shes far more fascinated with the sociological implications of a woman trying to escape into the wilderness by strapping books to her feet or of ruth and walters playing a rolereversal game in which walters is dressed up in lipstick and a skimpy red dress <>
for those of you who think one of cinemas most unnecessary images was keitels free willy in campions the piano please consider keitel in lipstick and a skimpy red dress <>
{} i suppose some viewers could find themselves intrigued enough by the shifting nature of ruth and walters relationship to give its freakish elements a pass <>
i found it far too hard to take holy smoke seriously as anything other than an opportunity for campion to rattle our collective cage whether the image is a nude ruth urinating in front of walters or walters hallucinating ruth as a manyarmed indian goddess <>
its not so much shallow as it is garish and overwrought an important message movie without a solid base of characterization to ground it <>
it has begun to appear that campion is more concerned with filming themes than with filming stories struggling against oppression without making that oppression recognizable in human terms <>
theres no need to use terms like manhating for that kind of filmmaking clumsy just about says it all <>

[2950/1]
{} there are moments in this job when one is faced with separating the sobaditsentertaining from the justplainawful <>
at those times i wish i could become joe bob briggs and make the recommendation to check it out based simply on explosions naked breasts and cuban gangsterfu <>
but the specialist doesnt deserve such consideration <>
ponderous pretentious and acted with astounding indifference the specialist is a big fat bore with a couple of nice explosions <>
its too somber to work as camp and too tedious to work as anything else <>
{} sylvester stallone stars as ray quick a former cia demolitions expert now haunted by his past and hiring out his skills with explosives freelance <>
he is contacted by may munro sharon stone a woman obsessed with the murder of her parents at the hands of three thugs led by tomas eric roberts the son of a miami drug lord rod steiger <>
ray is unsure whether he wants to take the job until he becomes a bit too personally interested in mays attempts to get closer to tomas <>
he also discovers that the drug lords head of security is ned trent james woods rays former cia partner <>
trent carries a tenyear grudge for rays part in having him thrown out of the agency and plans to use mays vendetta to exact a little vengeance of his own <>
{} much as one might expect the specialist is being hyped on the pairing of boxoffice heavyweights stallone and stone <>
unfortunately both of them spend most of the film looking as though theyve just done a nyquil highball <>
stone swaggers through discos in slow motion wanders through her inexplicably massive house in slow motion has sex in slow motion <>
at some point director luis llosa needed to explain to stone that haunted and bored are entirely different emotions <>
stallone is even more comatose conveying rays deep reservoir of anguish and guilt through drooping eyelids and jaw muscle isometrics as well as speaking in what can only be described as an impersonation of henry kissinger with a head cold <>
perhaps that was one of the reasons behind a scene in which stallone dispatches a group of young hoods on a bus which was added after test screenings they needed at least some evidence that he had a pulse <>
{} the rest of the cast is nearly as bad <>
james woods tries to cut loose as the demented trent but he never makes for a particularly threatening villain <>
hes better when humiliating a bomb squad commander or making offhanded insults about a loud shirt <>
eric roberts typecast for most of his career as a loutmouthed sleazeball playswell a slightly more sedate sleazeball delivering lines like what i want i take straight out of the introduction to basic machismo handbook <>
and rod steiger who was given to overacting even in his academy awardwinning heyday is appalling as the cuban godfather doing an accent which rivals kevin costners robin hood as the worst in recent memory <>
{} there are a couple of moments in the specialist which are worth unintentional giggles <>
one is the illadvised scene in which stallone and stone stand together in a hotel room undressing each other while stone stares down at the top of the stallones head <>
another is trying to understand how stones may who looks about ten years older than roberts tomas was supposed to be a young girl when an adult roberts helped kill mays parents <>
but the specialist is simply braindead from top to bottom there are almost too many examples of stupidity to single one out but my personal favorite involves may faking her own death by tossing her wallet in with a yearold corpse <>
apparently they dont have photos on id in florida <>
{} i have to hand the pyrotechnics team credit for blowing up a hotel suite its a fairly impressive piece of work <>
but thats when i should have left <>
come to think of it i wish thats where id come in too <>

[17643/4]
{} im willing to forgive never been kissed many of its failings because for all practical purposes its a fantasy <>
i can over look the irony of a film about an adult returning to interact with teenagers which portray teens the same inane way adults usually think of them <>
i can let it slide that the tone is terminally bubbly when a touch of venom might have helped <>
i can even shrug my shoulders at the notion that drew barrymore was ever a spatupon teen wretch <>
sometimes a romantic comedy can get away with being ridiculous as it strives to pull us into its wish fulfillment <>
what it cant get away with is being lazy or being miscast the two blunders that insure never been kissed never had a chance <>
{} our highconcept premise finds yearold chicago suntimes copy editor josie geller barrymore offered her first real reporting assignment going undercover as a high school student <>
the assignment brings mixed emotions for josie a brainy high school outcast still smarting from her adolescent ostracism <>
as she begins her quest for a story josie finds herself drawn back into the world of the smart kids at south glen south high school including her new friend aldys leelee sobieski <>
thats before her editor john c reilly demands that josie get in with the in crowd and before josies arrested adolescent yearold brother rob david arquette also reenrolls and helps turn the onetime josie grossie into a potential prom queen <>
{} never been kissed does a serviceable job of telling josies story exploring how a woman comes to terms with the person she was and is <>
if only the script had shown as much dilligence with the other elements <>
arquettes character is potentially even more interesting than barrymores a jock who peaked at trying to relive his glory days but its generally watereddown and ignored <>
the romantic angle between josie and her english teacher michael vartan is halfheartedly developed muddles the entire point of the story are we supposed to believe that josie was incapable of finding true love before recreating her traumatic youth and builds to a spectacularly clumsy conclusion <>
most depressing of all is a ghastly device which finds josie wearing a miniature camera contributing nothing more to the story than pointless cutaways to josies coworkers gaping or cringing in embarrassment <>
{} theres plenty to gape and cringe at as barrymore plays josie <>
youve got to admire how gamely barrymore subjects herself to humiliating situations but shes all wrong for the lead role in her first feature as executive producer <>
even the marketing people at fox realize that shes most appealing as a sweet object of desire making the central image in the films publicity a photo of barrymore smiling coquettishly with knee drawn up to her chest <>
as a star carrying this film she looks out of her depth <>
its slightly embarrassing watching her play the professional josie as a tightlycoiffed fussbudget correcting everyones grammar and usage <>
as implausible as she may be as a high school senior she proves even more implausible as a grownup <>
{} you always want to like a film as goodnatured as never been kissed even though it wants so much to be liked <>
there simply isnt a nuance to the material that director raja gosnell manages to capture not a moment of sincere emotion nothing that doesnt look like it wouldnt exist if not for other movies about kids in high school <>
when the script manages to work in a wise observation like the idea that one popular person in high school can dictate whos cool and whos not it feels like someone tripped over it accidentally <>
never been kissed is most certainly a fantasy for anyone who ever felt like the quintessential high school outsider but the filmmakers are living in a fantasy world if they think thats all they need to deliver <>

[3251/8]
{} maybe its envy maybe its years of hollywood trying to sell every pretty boy or gorgeous girl as the next big thing and maybe its some combination of the two <>
for whatever reason both moviegoers and critics alike seem to have incredible difficulty acknowledging that attractiveness and talent could go hand in hand <>
paul newman was nearly sixt before it became widely acknowledged that there was more to this guy than his famous blue eyes he could actually act <>
when he won as best actor in for the color of money it was widely considered a lifetime achievement award but apparently newman had at least one more trick up his sleeve nobodys fool a small quiet drama driven by newmans delightfully weathered lead performance <>
{} newman plays donald sully sullivan an oftenunemployed construction worker living in the sleepy upstate new york town of north bath <>
after suffering an onthejob knee injury sullys days are largely spent playing poker bantering with his landlady jessica tandy and trying to squeeze some compensation out of the construcion companys owner carl roebuck bruce willis <>
but during this holiday season there are other opportunities <>
in town for thanksgiving is sullys son peter dylan walsh a son hes had an uneasy relationship with since sully left the family when peter was a baby <>
peter is having marital troubles of his own and when peter stays in town with his own son sully has the chance to look back on his life and begin to take on some degree of responsibility for it <>
{} writerdirector robert benton has a gift for making lowkey relationshipbased films kramer vs kramer places in the heart and nobodys fool is a worthy heir to that tradition <>
benton uses his snowcovered locations beautifully practically turning north bath into one of the characters in the story <>
in many ways nobodys fool is as much about north bath as it is about sully <>
this is a town where everyone really does know everyone else where local disputes are settled by a judge philip bosco who addresses people by their first names and where a guy like sully to all outward appearances a loser in life is still treated with a basic respect for his independent mind <>
when a local banker attempts to bring a theme park to north bath it is a demonstration of a fundamental misunderstanding of what the town is about a sense of family <>
{} that connectedness makes the relationships between characters in nobodys fool a rare joy <>
there is not a meanspirited moment to be found because even the characters who dont get along treat each other as fellow humans <>
sullys feud with carl is one of the few external conflicts in the film manifested primarily in a game of stealing a snowblower back and forth but even that exchange is essentially goodhumored <>
its one of the things that makes sully so appealing as a character as ornery as he can be he always treats people decently <>
his paternal relationship with sadsack coworker rub pruitt taylor vince is a pleasure to watch unfold and a simple moment when sully helps a senile older woman back to her home is handled without an ounce of condescension <>
its ironicand perhaps part of the point of nobodys foolthat the one relationship which seems forced is that between sully and peter <>
still theres something strangely satisfying about a meeting between an estranged father and son which doesnt include a shouting match or tears <>
{} however the main reason sully is so appealing is paul newman <>
he has reached a point in his career where he doesnt really play characters any more instead he slips into them like the flannel shirts sully favors <>
that is in no way meant to belittle what newman does as an actor <>
the fact is that he makes it all look effortless as though hes really been sully all his life and someone just happened to turn the camera on at this moment <>
the background for the character an abusive father his own abandonment of his family seems almost tacked on so the movie seems to be about something more but newman doesnt really need it <>
what we are watching is the story of a man who is somehow coming to terms with all the choices he has made in his life and choosing to move forward rather than stand in place <>
its newmans gift that he can do all that with a wellplaced sigh and a twinkle in those eyes <>

{} by any objective standard assuming the term isnt meaningless as it applies to film criticism detroit rock city is pretty inexcusable stuff <>
the humor sticks fairly consistently to drugs alcohol and other undesirable teen behavior <>
the catholic church is a constant target for insults with priests variously portrayed as larcenous or lecherous <>
the four principal characters have little or no personality and arent terribly sympathetic <>
its a frantically paced effort the infantile gags thrown around with a quantity beats quality mentality <>
a sensible adult human being clearly would be welladvised to hurl himself as far from this film as possible <>
{} unless of course that adult human being happens to have been a member of the kiss army in <>
thats when this nostalgic teen comedy is set sending its four garage bandmate protagonists hawk edward furlong jam sam huntington trip james debello and lex giuseppe andrews on a trip from their ohio home to detroit where they will do anything to score tickets to a concert by the band they adore kiss <>
the quartet find themselves caught up in various rowdy misadventures as they try to get into the cobo hall show including feuding with discolovers entering strip contests and trying to escape the wrath of jams fanatically religious mother lin shaye <>
{} director adam rifkin certainly took many of his cues for detroit rock city from the seminal film about high schoolers desperately seeking tickets to a hot bands concert paul bartels ramones lovein rock n roll high school <>
there are far worse models for a film of this kind <>
detroit rock city is a dumb film but its a dumb film with such high energy and such a shamelessly lowbrow sensibility that it feels like exactly the kind of film american pie wanted to be <>
teenage viewers may be content to snigger at the sex drugs and rock n roll gags but the cartoonish delivery of those gags makes them more fun than they have any right to be <>
{} then again i viewed detroit rock city through some fairly rosetinted spectacles <>
though sporadically guffawinducing as a teen sex farce its far more appealing as a pure nostalgia trip for a something exheadbanger <>
the soundtrack though heavy on the kiss tunes also delivers blue oyster cult cheap trick thin lizzy and the aforementioned ramones not to mention the occasional disco selection <>
the s icons track tapes stretch armstrong action figures and farrah fawcett posters among them set just the right atmosphere <>
but carl v dupres script is best appreciated by those who spent their adolescence fighting off the scorn of the kiss sucks contingent playing air guitar to ace frehley solos and dreaming of attending a true rock spectacle <>
its filled with throwaway kiss references only a true fan could love like trips ironic prei was made for lovin you insistence that kiss would never do some bull disco song <>
in all the ways that count you really did have to be there <>
{} it would be easy enough to begin and end with the idea that i was bored andor repulsed by detroit rock city annoyed by the projectile vomiting humor and the limp dialogue <>
i could rightly acknowledge my frustration with setups designed mostly to work teenage boys into a lather of lust or disgust <>
and i could note that while the performers work hard to be appealing theres just not much appealing about the characters <>
when it comes right down to it the four teens are just types representations of everyone who wanted to go to a kiss concert so bad they could taste the flashpot smokeguys like me for instance <>
detroit rock city isnt a good film <>
but its a film i couldnt resist <>
as hard as it is under the best of circumstances to watch a film objectively its even harder when youre watching the story of your life <>

underdog makes good comedies have been a staple of the studios liveaction repertoire from the absentminded professor to gus to the mighty ducks <>
that a significant portion of their audience wouldnt notice if they did mail it in makes it all the more impressive that they dont <>
cool runnings carries on a tradition of formula comedies exuding goodnatured energy and entertaining more than they have any right to <>
{} as advertised cool runnings tells the story sort of behind the first jamaican olympic bobsled team <>
derice brannock leon is a sprinter with olympic dreams whose dream is shattered when he and two other runners stumble during the final qualifying trials <>
unwilling to give up on the chance to be an olympian derice considers another sport bobsledding <>

blitzer reluctantly agrees to coach the team made up of derice sanka and the two other fallen sprinters surly baldheaded yul malik yoba and passive rich kid junior rawle e lewis <>
they train and head to calgary for a chance to qualify for the winter games <>
{} anyone who has ever seen a disney sports film or almost any sports film for that matter can tell you more or less exactly what to expect <>
the coach will be gruff towards his inept new charges do you think hell eventually warm up to them <>
there will be a montage of the team in training or playing their sport do you think theyll keep improving <>
there will be a hissable cartoonish villain who questions our heroes mettle do you think hell get his comeuppance <>
no one goes to these films to be overwhelmed by the originality of the story <>
its all about positive feeling and cool runnings delivers it <>
the slapstick training runs are lively enough so that the youngsters in my audience were screaming with delight <>
the bobsled footage is superb and the olympic village atmosphere is exciting <>
jamaica is disneyfied into an idealized colorful paradise replete with grinning waifs and free of most signs of poverty but its brightly filmed and after all this isnt a film which offers much in the way of social commentary <>
{} the performers are responsible for generating most of the charm each member of the team handling his stock part with aplomb <>
leon is a bit stiff but still appealing as the determined team leader <>
malik yuba glowers and grumbles effectively as yul and rawle e lewis junior is jittery and expressive <>
doug e doug gets the comic relief role as sanka and proves to be a winning presence <>
the biggest surprise however is john candy <>
in the past candys name in the credits has been almost as sure a sign of a comedy <>
ill hate as mickey rourkes has been of a drama ill hate <>
here candy plays the straight man instead of the buffoon and plays it well <>
it doesnt take much imagination to buy candy as a hasbeen anything but hes more than just serviceable <>
he plays blitzer surprisingly understated even when giving the obligatory inspirational speeches and allows the rest of the cast to carry most of the comedy <>
{} i could spend plenty of time nitpicking about what cool runnings didnt do or should have done <>
the real story behind the formation of the team is far less hollywood and thats not the only historical fact with which the film plays fast and loose <>
the nasty east german bobsledder and the us official with a grudge are both way over the top <>
but for my money the most important factor was that i left the theater smiling and feeling uplifted <>
its a film about success coming from hard work and determination and its a film i would be glad to take a family to see <>
thats a rarity and its worth praise on its own level <>

{} some films are so baldfaced in their attempt to have it both ways that you just have to hand it to em for their chutzpah <>
on one level for instance its obvious small soldiers wants to skewer gungho militarism <>
the setup finds defense contractor globotech purchasing a toy company with the cheerfully allamerican name of heartland attempting to diversify before postcold war downsizing downsizes it right out of existence <>
instructed by globotech boss gil mars denis leary to create stateoftheart action toys designer larry benson jay mohr slips a prototype weapons system microprocessor into the new commando elite and gorgonite action figure lines creating intelligent interactive toys designed with the same rigorous standards demanded by the us defense department perhaps the films best joke <>
{} the kicker is that the commando elite figures led by chip hazard voice of tommy lee jones are the merciless and vaguely racist bad guys programmed to seek out and destroy the gentle noble homeseeking archer frank langella and his insecure fellow gorgonites no one explains why the gorgonites couldnt have been programmed as slightly more challenging antagonists than the therapy group from the bob newhart show <>
when troubled teen alan abernathy gregory smith allies himself with the gorgonites he too becomes a commando target along with his new agey parents kevin dunn and ann magnuson and his wouldbe girlfriend christy kirsten dunst <>
as chip rallies his troops against the enemy framed pattonlike by the us flag and spouting a succession of nonsequitur patriotic cliches it becomes clear that director joe dante and his team of writers want us to nod knowingly at how the destruction to come will be the result of hardwired hyperhawkishness <>
{} those same folks also know that the destruction to come will be considered bitchin cool by a contingent in the audience which might be inclined to by small soldiers merchandise <>
in an era where action figure tieins are as much a part of popcorn moviemaking as plastic fast food cups small soldiers bypasses the inconvenient middle step of figuring out how to turn the characters into toys <>
it also bypasses the inconvenient middle step of explaining why we should side with the peaceloving gorgonites when the film makes the commando elites assault complete with flaming tennis balls nail guns and makeshift helicopters look like so much fun <>
in many of his previous films including gremlins which is the most obvious model for small soldiers dante was able to give a dark edge to his invasions of suburban serenity <>
he loses that edge early on in small soldiers to meet the demands of marketing <>
its almost as though the checks mars the god of war get it passes out to every one at the end to buy their silence bought off the filmmakers as well <>
{} it would be easier to dismiss small soldiers if the result werent so entertaining not to mention frequently amusing <>
for adults it will be clever mostly in an injokey sort of way from references to gremlins gizmo to the use of heman icons like ernest borgnine george kennedy and clint walker as voices for the commando elite <>
the rest of the voice talent spinal tap alums christopher guest michael mckean and harry shearer reunited as gorgonites sarah michelle gellar and christina ricci voicing mutant versions of a barbiestyle doll isnt too shabby either <>
the humans may be a pretty boring lot excluding phil hartman in his last film role as christys consumer electronicsobsessed dad but the combination of stan winstons animatronics and perfectlyintegrated cgi versions make the toy story a fairly lively one <>
{} small soldiers is just weird and twisted enough to be worth a matinee <>
its also a poorlyconcealed version of the same action worship you find in a film like armageddon though its almost better when the worship is thoroughly unironic <>
the token attempts at satire notwithstanding small soldiers plays most like a juicedup featurelength commercial for real commando elite action figures available now at a store near you <>

{} ive always wanted to be in films says dancerchoreographer pablo veron at one point in the tango lesson to which writerdirector sally potter replies ive always wanted to be a dancer <>
well both get their chance in a grating featurelength selfindulgence disguised as a fanciful romance <>
potter plays a filmmaker named sally visiting paris after difficulties getting financing for her latest project which is thoroughly unbelievable since the project in question involves the pure box office gold of models dressed in primary colors pursued by a legless fashion designer <>
there she meets veron and convinces the dancer to teach her the tango <>
along the way they sort of fall in love dance sort of break up dance some more sort of get back together again and dance a whole lot more <>
{} somewhere buried in this collection of dance sequences are a few meditations on ones calling in life the need to surrender control and the connections between various art forms <>
more power to you if you manage to exhume them <>
the tango lesson carries no emotional pull since both lead performers have the seasoned acting chops ofwell a director and a dancer <>
some of the dance sequences are impressive particularly verons solo tap number in a kitchen but the portentous and pretentious flow of the narrative robs them of all joy imagine gene kelly directed by fellini and youll understand why the tango lesson is such a bizarre experience <>
robby mullers typically impressive blackandwhite cinematography only emphasizes that the film is an empty visual exercise a project so personal it can only leave the audience wondering why in the world it should care <>
potters spin on fellinis is merely a moderately depressing record of the filmmakers midlife crisis in which she attempts to assure the world that she could too be a ballerina if she really wanted to <>

{} all right ill admit it im guilty of a bias towards writers <>
perhaps its the part of me that identifies with them or the romantic image of a guy alone in a room staring down a blank sheet of paper in a battered manual smithcorona until the paper blinks first <>
the fact is that when i feel a project has gone sour the writer is frequently the last target of my wrath and the first one to get the benefit of the doubt <>
not this time <>
i cant think of a director alive who could have done anything with cops robbersons or an actor who could have made it watchable <>
to call this script inept would be to give it more credit than it deserves <>
{} chevy chase stars as norman robberson a suburban father of three whose family doesnt respect him at all <>
to compensate for his timidity in real life norman watches every tv cop show he can memorizes police procedures and worships their heroics from afar <>
the chance to worship up close comes when a counterfeiter robert davi moves in next door and the police decide to set up a stakeout in the robbersons home <>
the veteran in the stakeout team is jake stone jack palance a growling tough guy who immediately commands everyones respect <>
meanwhile norman gets caught up in the action and in his attempt to help out ends up jeopardizing the entire operation <>
{} it is exceedingly difficult to imagine what bernie somers was thinking when he started putting this mess together <>
it often seems as though he never developed the idea beyond a singlesentence pitchcops move in with a loser who idolizes cops <>
there isnt a single original situation or character to be found but that can be said of eight scripts out of ten that come out of hollywood <>
the more telling point is that somers didnt seem to have a clue where to go with this story <>
the predictable resolution would have been for milquetoast norman to discover an inner reserve of strength and end up saving the day <>
but even that simplistic an answer seems to be beyond his grasp <>
norman begins and ends the film exactly the same and there isnt even a pat answer provided for why there is anything different in the way his family would treat him <>
{} then there are the other characterizations which run from the stereotypical to the incomprehensible <>
jason james richter free willy as the rebellious son and fay masterson the man without a face as the teenage daughter are completely without personality and diane weist is saddled with an unpleasant shrewishness <>
robert davi who by now might as well have the word villain tattooed to his forehead bounces from nasty to clownish as the counterfeiter <>
among the creative stretches in the plot are the daughter falling for the hunky young cop david barry gray and the family ending up hostages <>
please my heart cant take any more surprises <>
{} the biggest losers however are probably the two names above the title <>
chase as ive already noted is stuck with a character who goes nowhere dooming him from the start <>
still it would have been nice if he hadnt walked through the film as though he were still stunned by the cancellation of his talk show <>
hes not even as endearingly incompetent as the vacation series clark griswold just deathly boring <>
jack palance doesnt fare much better but he does have an innate gruff charm that transcends the role as written however that still doesnt explain why the robbersons seem so instantly drawn to jake despite his abusiveness nor why jake eventually reciprocates <>
if all you want is the chance to see palance flare his nostrils and roll his own cigarettes rent city slickers again <>
{} i laughed exactly twice during cops robbersons once when chase attempts to roll his own cigarette and once during a coda which plays on palances famous onearmed pushups <>
even at bargain prices thats two bucks a laugh <>

{} mike myers transforms himself in in virtually every way a performer can transform himself <>
myers plays steve rubell the nightclub impresario who created the manhattan disco to be the center of the party universe in the closing years of the s <>
rubell presides over his kingdom in a heavylidded barbiturate stupor wheezing a forced monotone cackle as he moves among his glitterati guests <>
in his first truly dramatic screen performance myers is still recognizable with his openmouthed little boy grin but here he uses it to create an overgrown little boy convinced he can only find friends by throwing the coolest party <>
wearing izod shirts and sweaters thinning hair perched pointlessly on top of his head rubell is a protogates portrait of entrepreneurial geekdom <>
if people wont play with him because they like him hell make them play with him because they need him <>
{} rubell is a fascinating character performed by myers with a mix of savvy pathos and selfabsorption <>
if writerdirector mark christopher had had the common sense to make the story of steve rubell he might have created a great film <>
instead he makes his protagonist a new jersey kid named shane oshea ryan phillippe who comes to manhattan in to break away from his deadend family <>
he first manages to catch rubells eye and gain entry into the club then lands a job as a busboy eventually moving up the studio social ladder to bartender <>
along the way he befriends another busboy named greg cluelesss breckin meyer and gregs wife aspiring disco diva anita salma hayek <>
he also becomes infatuated with julie black neve campbell a soap opera ingenue whose jerseytothebigtime success story inspired him to action <>
{} s baseline narrative is so trite it almost plays like a parody a discoera goof on midnight cowboy or some far less seminal corruption of the innocent melodrama <>
naturally the fame and flash go immediately to shanes head as he poses for modeling shoots and buys a camaro with personalized plates naturally he is lured into a sordid world of sex drugs and money naturally he begins to alienate his friends and family <>
christopher heads down every obvious path in the interactions between shane greg anita and julie apparently oblivious to the fact that every one of those characters is a piece of cardboard <>
perhaps it was his idea of irony like studio itself his movie invites people in so they can stand around and be attractive <>
{} the plotting and pacing are so relentlessly predictable that the film doesnt even work well as a sociology lesson <>
occasionally it offers peeks at the side rooms or basement hot spots where the elite meet to revel in their eliteness occasionally it focuses on the politics of succeeding in an environment of glamour for glamours sake <>
shanes voiceover narration dutifully informs us why studio was so unique and popular but theres never enough energy for us to believe him or care <>
spends minutes pointing offhandedly at this or that detail like a bored tour guide <>
for a film that includes moneylaundering ripping off the mob sex drugs celebrities and plenty of boogie oogie oogieing it almost never gets the pulse racing <>
{} the notable exceptions are the scenes involving myers as rubell <>
sure the character isnt perfectly realized in fact it probably seems better simply because its surrounded by so much uninspired junk <>
there is something undeniably intriguing about rubell <>
however as his king of the playground glee mingles with selfdestructive anxiety and paranoia <>
its also amusing watching him tell a talk show host the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom after weve seen him lying in a pile of money drooling vomit <>
theres a great story in that unhappy collection of contradictions but you wont find it amidst the smothering cliches of mark christophers script <>
with all the strangerthanfiction truth at his disposal he somehow found the least interesting approach possible <>
steve rubell would have been disgusted to see studio turned into something somundane <>

{} i am reminded of a favorite line from the coen brothers film barton fink in this era of the wildly overproduced blockbuster <>
barton fink an intellectual writer who has come to hollywood in the early s reports to his studio boss that hes having trouble getting started on his first assignment a wrestling film starring wallace beery <>
the baffled mogul responds wallace beery wrestling picturewhat do you need a road map <>
when it comes to genre filmmaking theres an easy way to get the audience to respond the way you want them to respond and theres the way writerdirector stephen sommers chooses to craft his remake of the mummy <>
rarely has a film exterted so much narrative effort to say so little <>
{} that narrative begins in bc where the egyptian high priest imhotep arnold vosloo after an affair with the pharaohs mistress is buried alive to carry a curse on the world should he ever be awakened <>
flash forward to where soldier of fortune nick oconnell brendan fraser discovers the lost city of hamunaptra legendary site of untold treasure and unbeknownst to anyone imhoteps tomb <>
flash forward again three years where egyptologistlibrarian evelyn rachel weisz and her neerdowell brother jonathan john hannah learn that the jailed oconnell knows the location of hamunaptra and win his freedom in exchange for his aid <>
thus begins a journey to the lost city which results in the release of imhotep who emerges into the th century with a mission an attitude and a whole lot of nasty supernatural powers <>
{} unlike the original this version is more actionadventure than horror focusing on derringdo over scaringdo <>
it certainly delivers its share of fight sequences some of them are even fairly rousing combining unique visual effects with narrow escapes and a dose of visual humor <>
the echoes of raiders of the lost ark are obvious but the mummy may actually owe an equal debt to sam raimis army of darkness in its attempts at supernatural slapstick <>
though nowhere near the level of the indiana jones films and indeed not even necessarily at the level of army of darkness the mummy at times manages to deliver the goods <>
{} the goals of a film like the mummy should be fairly simple yet sommers manages to miss the point entirely over and over again <>
the plot summary above doesnt do remote justice to the sacks of exposition extraneous plot threads and gonowhere characters with which the mummy is burdened <>
the film takes forever to set up the premise with the exploration party finally reaching hamunaptra at about the one hour mark <>
unnecessary complications ensue with the inclusion of a rival team of explorers guided by a sniveling former colleague of oconnells kevin j oconnor increasing the body count in the least efficient manner possible <>
the danger to evelyn targeted by imhotep as part of his plan to resurrect his former love is buried beneath the ten plagues of egypt which imhotep conveniently controls to allow for some more cool special effects <>
theres no economy to the mummy no understanding of how to create a solid hero a solid villain and a solid conflict and let the action roll <>
{} it would be easy enough to snipe at the dopey dialogue and silly performances in the mummy im still waiting for someone to convince me that brendan fraser has leadingman charm especially since it would deserve every snipe <>
there are a few clever touches <>
but mostly sommers seems to show the typical blockbuster disdain for characters and situations which do anything more than set up the next effects shot <>
yet such complaints miss the point that the mummy isnt even a good brainless action film with its lumbering pacing <>
all the jawdropping visual trickery in the world doesnt help if a film wanders around in circles before pulling out its a material <>
groan if you must but the mummy needed to be wrapped up much more tightly <>

{} some concepts are funny on paper even if theres no way they could ever be classic comedies in reality the crew has such a concept <>
is it funny envisioning a quartet of aging mob tough guys trying to regain their swagger in their sunset years sure it is <>
there have been other comedies about seniors turning to a life of crime rather than going gentle into that good night like the george burnsart carneylee strassburg vehicle going in style but a wiseguy twist sounds promising <>
it may not be chockablock with rapiersharp witticisms and there may be a prostate gag or two to wade through but there should be a few laughs right <>
theres only so much you can do to screw up a solid concept right <>
{} in fact the crew screws up its solid concept so badly and in so many provocative variations that its practically a road map for misbegotten filmmaking <>
the four aging mafiosi bobby bartellemeo richard dreyfuss joey bats pistella burt reynolds mike the brick donatelli dan hedaya and tony mouth donato seymour cassel are residents of a miami retirement hotel thats about to become the latest victim of south beach gentrification <>
faced with the prospect of a skyrocketing rent for their newlychic digs the boys decide to make their home a less appealing place to live by setting it up to look like a gangland murder has taken place there though the body they use is already dead <>
the fake hit has the desired effect of scaring off prospective tenants but theres an unfortunate side effect the dead body whose head they blew off was the father of a drug lord miguel sandoval whos determined to wreak vengeance on the responsible parties <>
{} ah the wacky complications that are possible with the inclusion of a pissedoff drug lord <>
and imagine how many more wacky complications are possible when you include a subplot involving a miami detective carrieanne moss trying to fend off the advances of her colleague and philandering exboyfriend jeremy piven <>
and still yet even how many more wacky complications are possible when a stripper jennifer tilly whos beginning to resemble divine above the neck learns of the boys involvement in the fake killing and blackmails them into killing her delicatessen heiress stepmother lainie kazan in full oy gevalt mode but the boys only kidnap her and fake her death instead only in so doing they manage to piss off the drug lord even further <>
can you feel your sides splitting at the crazy goofy hilarity <>
and can you feel a tear trickling down your cheek because bobby is really a sensitive guy searching high and low for the daughter he hasnt seen in years <>
{} the reason the crew stinks or at least the main reason is that its not about what its about <>
a movie about geriatric mobsters could be funny <>
you could have them interact with their modern counterparts to show them how its done old school like a scorsese version of space cowboys or focus on what kind of rackets they could run in their seniorheavy milieu <>
theres good character stuff there too what happens when youre left to fossilize after once being part of a culture of macho action <>
{} but the crew isnt about any of that <>
it isnt about anything really because theres so much garbage thrown into minutes of script that it never develops anything remotely resembling comic momentum <>
the personalities of the four principles are inanely simplistic leaving the actors to overact madly in compensation reynolds in particular is wretched beyond all description <>
director michael dinner meanwhile overdirects madly in compensation operating under the delusion that you can somehow make a terrible script funny by filming everyone in fisheye closeup <>
even the editing chops gags into such minute shreds that setups are separated from their punch lines <>
something this fundamentally incompetent should carry a government warning sticker <>
{} there are exactly two moments in the crew when the experience of watching it is remotely tolerable <>
one involves a silly homage to goodfellas with our protagonists strutting through the kitchen of a buffet restaurant after paying off a busboy <>
the other involves sandovals drug lord growing frustrated at dealing with his incompetent underlings <>
for the other minutes the crew isnt simply unfunny its a test of an audiences good will practically an exercise in making every wrong narrative performance or technical choice possible <>

{} it may be my imagination but the last two years seem to have been a particularly good time to be a young actor <>
films focusing on younger characters have been everywhere from free willy to searching for bobby fischer to king of the hill to this boys life <>
whether its representative of some societal yearning for a return to innocence a rare influx of young talent or some happy confluence of the two comingofage dramas have become nearly as ubiquitous as hugh grant <>
none of which makes a good one any less desirable and the slingshot is a good one indeed a sharply written swedish import with a singular perspective and exceptional performances <>
{} based on an autobiographical novel by roland schutt the slingshot tells the story of tenyearold roland jasper salen and his trials and tribulations living in s sweden <>
he is a boy with two strikes against him the child of a dogmatically socialist father stellan skarsgaard and a jewish mother basia frydman <>
this lineage makes him the target of schoolyard bullies sadistic schoolmasters and government officials who tend to use him as a scapegoat <>
even with his family he is not safe as his older brother niclas olund an aspiring boxer uses him as a punching bag <>
but in spite of his many obstacles roland navigates through his difficult world with determination and an inventive spirit <>
{} as with the other recent films i mentioned the slingshot rests squarely on the small shoulders of its young star and jasper salen is up to the task <>
with a round open face reminiscent of a christmas storys peter billingsley salen manages to convey both innocence and toughness in the delicate balancing act required by ake sandgrens adaptation <>
while many things happen to roland he is never merely a receptacle <>
he exhibits a cockiness born of necessity and a gift for utilizing the tools at his disposal to get ahead <>
when another boy offers roland a used bike he hasnt the money for roland offers to repair and paint some other bikes to repay his debt <>
after a fight with his brother results in roland owing his father money as well he tries to earn it by selling balloons made out of the condoms his mother distributes illegally <>
roland is always thinking and it is this intelligence that comes through in salens performance <>
he is complemented by a wonderful supporting cast particularly stellan skarsgaard as rolands father a driven man who compensates for his crippling sciatica by pushing himself and his family to their limits <>
{} although the slingshot is as one might expect primarily episodic it is still rich enough thematically that it never feels like merely a loose collection of scenes <>
foremost among these themes is the clash of capitalism and socialism personified by roland himself <>
while his father lectures to him about the revolution roland fashions many creations with condoms and imagines himself credited as the inventor of the underwater sock and the condom slingshot <>
when roland shows a cat his newly refurbished bike and says to it thats mine it is as succinct a statement of rebellion as one might imagine <>
there is also a nicely played scene in which rolands father who is acting as a body double for a portrait of the king momentarily forgets his politics when he puts on a pair of expensive shoes <>
this is not to say that the slingshot acts as little more than a onesided political tract sandgren is equally critical of the restrictive government policies which turn the schutts into criminals for advocating birth control <>
however it is rolands internal struggle with his heritage that makes his external struggles even more potent <>
{} the slingshots key failing may be that it tries to do too much and some of the scenes begin to seem repetitive <>
the obligatory moment of sexual awakening seems just thatobligatoryand ends with a scene surprisingly lacking in emotional punch <>
a late series of events which involves rolands implication in a crime bogs down seriously and removes him from the relationships which drive his story <>
those relationships particularly rolands complex interaction with his father are what make the slingshot memorable <>
thanks to jasper salens splendid work the slingshot takes its place as a worthy addition to the list of fine comingofage films <>

{} if there has been one theme one can identify running through the work of director barry levinson it is the search for the american dream <>
he brought us the ambitious salesmen of tin men the optimistic immigrants of avalon and the visionary bugsy all darklytinged stories of guys trying to make their mark and make it big <>
jimmy hollywood is another such story but it is lacking something previous levinson projects had namely a firm grasp on what the protagonsists dreams were <>
there are interesting ideas in the script and some of the dry humor characteristic of levinsons dialogue but its never all that compelling because the character of jimmy alto is too schizophrenic and with him the tone of the whole film <>
{} jimmy hollywood is the nickname of jimmy alto joe pesci a struggling actor who has gone so far as to buy an advertisement for himself on a bus stop bench <>
he also adores the hollywood of the glamorous s and s and spends afternoons memorizing the stars on the walk of fame with addled friend william christian slater <>
that hollywood is strongly at odds with the reality jimmy sees around him however and when a couple of crimes hit close to home he decides to do something about it <>
along with william jimmy catches a thief and turns him in with a note identifying the captors as the sos <>
when the public begins expressing appreciation for the vigilantes jimmy begins to play the role for all its worth to the dismay of longsuffering girlfriend lorena victoria abril <>
{} at various times levinson appears to be trying to tell two different stories through jimmy <>
one is about the thankless life of being a struggling actor including the cattle calls waiting tables and shameless selfpromotion necessary to make it <>
jimmy never doubts for a minute that his big break is just around the corner and when his vigilante persona jericho becomes a media sensation he is unwilling to give up what he considers the role of a lifetime <>
at the same time levinson paints a picture of a onetime tinseltown which has disintegrated into a city of drug deals homelessness and atm muggings <>
what happens is that it is never clear what motivates jimmy <>
one moment it appears that he is a starryeyed altruist who wants only to return hollywood to its former glory the next he is simply a publicityhungry wouldbe actor using crime to make a name for himself <>
the jimmy who wants to strike fear into the hearts of criminals doesnt gel with the jimmy who reveals himself for a big sendoff <>
it is typical of levinson to make his heroes motives less than completely pure but in this instance theyre simply muddled <>
it is difficult to care all that much about jimmy and its difficult to figure out whether levinson wants us to focus on his characters or the setting <>
{} it is also a simple truth that jimmy hollywood was a hard film for me to like <>
while it has its humorous moments its too grim to be a purely entertaining comedy and it doesnt explore its dark themes deeply enough to be an insightful drama <>
its two principal characters are frequently more pathetic than they are sympathetic the pacing is extremely deliberate and the shifts in tone had me shifting in my seat a lot <>
when i did find interesting elements it was more a case of depatched admiration than enjoyment <>
{} among the objects of admiration were two performances neither of them joe pescis <>
pesci needs to step back from motormouthed new yorkers because they are all beginning to look the same <>
his costars however are quite good <>
victoria abril livens up the token girlfriend role with some strong scenes particularly a hillside farewell <>
the big surprise is a funny and affecting christian slater whose forgetful william does the lowkey performance in untamed heart one better <>
slater is developing into a complete actor and his performance here is extremely interesting <>
yet perhaps interesting is the faint praise with which i ultimately damn jimmy hollywood <>

{} an opening title in the mod squad conscientiously defines mod for the viewing audience then goes the extra mile of defining squad as well <>
its your first clue that the target audience is that ultradesirable and apparently lexicallychallenged youth demographic rather than primarily baby boomers familiar with the television series <>
not surprisingly the mod squad is a loud and generally stupid action film with a dose of teenangst melodrama <>
impressively it even compounds the misery with a ridiculously convoluted plot <>

one of the places they still seem adapt at getting into is trouble trouble which gets particularly nasty when greer turns up dead and implicated in drug trafficking <>
for no really good reason other than a continuation of the film the mod squad begins its own investigation uncovering a conspiracy which would baffle xfiles creator chris carter <>
{} you might think that a dense multilayered plot would indicate faith in audience intelligence but youd be very mistaken indeed <>
the mod squad uses its innumerable narrative threads like shiny objects to distract an infant never really caring whether they make for a more interesting or engaging story <>
julie spends most of the film getting reinvolved with an old flame josh brolin while pete and linc track down leads in a plot line that runs mostly parallel <>
meanwhile pete has a sensitive moment with his estranged parents a goofy drug dealer michael lerner dances with linc to my favorite things <>
pete and julie almost kinda sorta get together and lincs car is the object of everwackier damage at petes hand <>
it doesnt even matter that many of the subplots drift together by the films conclusion its short attention span theater mentality makes it not at all worth the effort to keep up <>

cute gag only the mod squad hasnt earned that level of selfdeprecation <>
its the kind of film where a guy spills his guts to someone who has chased him down yelling im a cop despite the absence of any badge or weapon <>
its the kind of film where the villains spell out their plans in more detail than james bond baddies <>
and its the kind of film that truly defines gratuitious sex violence and profanity <>
a bad movie cant be a commentary on the state of bad moviemaking <>
{} the strange thing is that much of that formulaic foolishness could have worked if the mod squad had been played straighter as an homage to formulaic earlys cop dramas <>
the only time the film is at all diverting is when b c smiths funky retroscore plays under a dimly lit chase scene giving it that fauxgritty vibe <>
director scott silver simply cant maintain that energy not when hes wasting time on choppy music video editing of his characters tender personal moments <>
the mod squad is busy and headacheinducing and rarely even manages to channel that into viscerally effective action <>

yeah robinbilly would then chime in we had a great time making it <>
whereupon would ensue much goodnatured riffing between the two guaranteed to have the hosts chuckling merrily as we returned to the studio <>
for those uninitiated in promospeak allow me to provide a translation <>
the real plot of fathers day has nothing to do with two men attorney jack lawrence crystal and struggling writerperformer dale putley williams who are both told by the same exlover nastassja kinski that one of them is the father of her runaway yearold son scott charlie hofheimer <>
the real plot of fathers day is robin williams and billy crystal running around being robin williams and billy crystal <>
{} that plot shouldnt have been too hard to pull off <>
crystal and williams are funny talented men and the screenwriting team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandel has produced charmers like splash parenthood and city slickers <>
fathers day however isnt merely disappointing <>
it is one of the laziest and most ineptly constructed comedies of the decade <>
i spent minutes staring at a screen in blankfaced astonishment waiting for this group of talented people to show me something remotely entertaining <>
i wanted someone anyone to explain to me what in gods name they were thinking when they set this beast in motion <>
{} of course i knew the answer to that question <>
they were thinking that they had robin williams and billy crystal and that everything else would just sort itself out <>
fathers day is filled with scenes where it looked like the script consisted of the phrase robin does something crazy here <>
you can see it when williams tries out different ways to greet his newfound son you can see it when williams pretends to be a german record producer for the express purpose of rattling off a string of car names in a funny accent <>
it is the rare film which has made good use of williams improvisational skills good morning vietnam comes to mind <>
more frequently a careless creative team like this one will use williams as a comedic inagaddadavida drum solo filling time between fade in and fade out <>
without a structure to contain him robin williams becomes a train just looking for a place to jump the tracks <>
{} crystal isnt even that lucky consigned with the rest of the cast to picking up whatever scraps williams leaves behind <>

you might think fathers day would be built around the conflict between the opposing personalities of the two leads crystal as the uptight lawyer and williams as the unhinged creative type but youd be wrong <>
williams and crystal hardly raise their voices to one another perhaps fearing that the audience only wants to see them as funny chums <>
the film is so desperate for some kind of conflict that it drags in a couple of drug dealers as well as scotts other father bruce greenwood <>
respectively they provide the opportunity to watch a mosh pit full of headbutting and a portapotty sliding down a hillside <>
thanks for coming <>
{} most critics tend to reserve their greatest outrage for films featuring pauly shore chris farley or even jim carrey perhaps believing that moronic physical comedy is whats wrong with modern filmmaking <>
i consider fathers day more contemptible by far <>
whatever else one might think about farley or carrey they give everything theyve got to a role <>
no one involved in fathers day even seems to be trying <>
the performances are lifeless the plot incorporates that overused trope of the workaholic who gets religion about family life and the dialogue is so devoid of creativity that it recycles a gag about the odds of lou gehrig dying of lou gehrigs disease comparative stories about how long ago you first heard that one mailed to this address please <>
im sure the stars had a wonderful time making fathers day just like burt reynolds dom deluise and company had a wonderful time making those cannonball run movies <>
as the credits started to role i began to hope that fathers day would include outtakes something to justify my time <>
they also would have provided a fitting postcard coda for a film which amounts to a working vacation for robin williams and billy crystal at our expense having a good time glad you were there <>

{} pulpnoir is tough to pull off in this era of selfreferential hipness <>
strangely enough pulpnoir satire may be even tougher to pull off since the entire genre itself fairly reeks of selfparody every time a hardboiled guy a hardboiled situation and hardboiled voiceover dialogue combine on screen <>
now take that pulpnoir satire and base it on a real pulp novel and youve got the potential for a smug disaster <>
the woman chaser shouldnt work <>
it couldnt work <>
{} writerdirector robinson devor had the recipe for yet another inert genre parody in his hands but somehow he turned it into something so wonderfully warped its almost impossible to resist <>
based on the novel of the same name by charles willeford the woman chaser stars patrick warburton erstwhile seinfeld david puddy as richard hudson a used car dealer recently returned to his hometown of los angeles circa <>
richard unexpectedly finds himself experiencing an existential crisis overwhelmed by the need to abandon sales and create something of lasting value <>
he therefore sets out to write and direct his own film a gritty drama about an alienated trucker <>
with the help of his stepfather leo paul malevitz a washedup former filmmaker richard gives the sales pitch of his life and finds his project picked up by mammoth studios <>
but he could be in for hard lessons about the biz <>
{} if the above summary sets you to puzzling over the films title fear not <>
in the s and s willeford wrote within a genre where publishers couldnt care less what was inside the cover so long as a broad in a tight sweater and a provocative title were on the cover <>
the author took advantage of that freedom to write unconventional stories like the one that inspired the alec baldwin vehicle miami blues as well as the woman chaser originally titled the director <>
robinson devor uses willefords own offbeat sensibility as a launching pad then turns the woman chaser into such a twisted combination of subversion and homage that you can only ride along where it takes you <>
devor nails the genre atmosphere helped greatly by kramer morgenthaus marvelous blackandwhite a la kiss me deadly cinematography and warburtons noteperfect narration <>
parody only seems to work when its inspired by genuine affection and devor clearly loves film noir mannered conventions and all <>
{} he also figures out that his story is a way to give a fresh twist to the trite independent film premise of making an independent film <>
from richards intense pitch of his films concept to his unconventional methods of eliciting performances to his obsession with the perfect edited length of his film the woman chaser finds a kick for every predictable situation <>
devor even scripts the most trenchant line ive ever heard on the phenomenon of people assuming they can write a film richard during his quest for an artistic outlet sculpture and architecture require years of training and practice but a screenplay <>
taking the concept out of the present day filmmaking world gives it the perfect touch of the surreal without even the faintest hint of the superior outsider attitude that too often hinders movies about making movies <>
{} not all the quirkiness in the woman chaser works of course <>
there are ebbs in devors pacing and a narrative that doesnt always hang together except as a showcase for warburtons tremendously entertaining performance <>
yet even then theres entertainment value in virtually every aborted narrative thread <>
and youve got to love a film that launches the bearish warburton on a barechested ballet or lands him in bed with a something salvation army volunteer <>
its too easy to praise a film simply for being different but the woman chaser is different in all the right ways <>
its energetic and imaginative where other parodies are too often limp and witless <>
it skewers the ego of filmmakers but never loses its love for filmmaking <>
it even pokes fun at film noir without resorting to predictable gags the woman chaser is a surprise in every positive sense of the word because really it shouldnt work <>

{} james merendinos slc punk has something deep and insightful to say about the nature of youthful rebellion sort of maybe i think <>
its sort of hard to tell through all the bombast of merendinos hyperactive period piece which tries to be a sort of nostalgic breakfast club for the dead kennedys set but misses the point entirely <>
its one thing to make a film about teens grousing over the sellouts of adulthood and the trials of coping with societal expectations and target it at the teens themselves its quite another to make such a film and target it at those whove already been through that melodramatic wringer <>
the simple enjoyment that might have come from the time and the tunes instead turns into a minute wait for the characters to get a clue <>
{} our tour guide through slc punk is stevo matthew lillard who along with his best friend heroin bob michael goorjian is one of the few true punks in the capital of conservative utah during the conservative reagan era circa <>
the tour consists largely of an anthropological dig through stevo and bobs twisted clique which includes an independently wealthy and extremely paranoid drug dealer til schweiger the lads respective ladyfriends jennifer lien and annabeth gish and an acid casualty devon sawa <>
along the way we learn about the various subcategories of salt lake city youth the influence of stevos s radicalturnedyuppie father christopher mcdonald and where to go for real beer when you need it <>
{} like many an independent comedy slc punk has enough frantic energy to guarantee at least a few belly laughs notably during stevos spin through a party describing the various subplots in action and a scene showing our protagonists as prepunk dungeons and dragonsobsessed middleschoolers <>
also like many an independent comedy it often has nothing but frantic energy <>
for every decent gag or clever insight you can count on at least two or three selfindulgent uses of direct address to the camera in which stevo rails about religious oppression or the plague of poseurs ie those who son the garb without walking the walk <>
scenes which im assuming should come off as either amusing or wisebeyondhisyears instead come off as merely damp <>
if spittle were diamonds matthew lillards performance would surely be a piece of comic jewelry fit for a princess <>
once again a filmmakers attempt to connect with the audience through narration becomes a lazy failure <>
{} slc punk tries to score its major profundity points when stevo is hit by the bombshell that rebellious youth are just conformists of a different kind <>
well you can file that one under d for duh stevos revelation is one with which any audience member over the age of will already be quite familiar <>
its that kind of pseudowisdom that makes slc punk far more tiresome than a film built around devotion to the ramones should have been <>
when tragedy strikes one of the films significant characters late in the film and merendino tries to play it as a genuine tragedy you realize he hasnt remotely earned an emotional response <>
slc punk blasts through its set pieces with little filmmaking prowess then expects to tie it all together by having stevo blubber away at misspent youth poseurs indeed <>

{} the advertising campaign for the crow city of angels invites us to believe in the power of another but it sounds more like a plea for sympathy <>
after all what are you supposed to do when you want to make a sequel but the star of the first film is no longer with us <>
well i suppose the obvious answer swallow your checkbook and allow the crow to rest in peace was unacceptable but this is one sequel which seemed utterly doomed from the first minute <>
s the crow was a film with a striking look but it owed virtually every ounce of emotional resonance it had to the tragic death of star brandon lee while filming the scene in which his character is killed <>
city of angels has no such back story to prop up its retread of the first film and seems determined to substitute excess for emotion in what has to rank as one of the years most grueling cinematic ordeals <>
{} the setting is the near future in the city of angels where a drug lord named judah earl richard brooks controls all <>
it is the misfortune of a mechanic named ash vincent perez and his young son to witness a gang of judahs thugs murdering someone and they in turn are murdered as well <>
but a little thing like death cant keep ash down not when he becomes one with the vengeanceminded spirit of the crow <>
he befriends a tattoo artist named sarah mia kirshner but he has little time to spend on relationships <>
his mission is to find the people responsible for his sons death including judah himself and destroy them so that his soul might find peace <>
{} if there is anyone you should really feel sorry for in this mess it is vincent perez because i dont think he ever had a chance <>
this isnt like val kilmer stepping into batmans boots or pierce brosnan taking over as its more like someone trying to replace patrick stewart as captain picard <>
the crows fans are passionate about the film and in particular about the man they see as headed towards stardom before he was cut down in his prime <>
perez has the right look for the part he looks serviceably eerie in the crows face paint and leather duster but hes not brandon lee <>
thats not even a criticism because im not convinced lee was anything that special <>
the point is that those who come to this film because they loved the crow are going to have a real problem with this guy with a french accent taking over for their hero <>
{} then again i suppose perez always could have said no especially once he got a look at a script which has him making his entrance emerging from a fountain of water in tattered clothes looking like esther williams on the way to a rave <>
there is plenty of silliness like that in city of angels it tries to stake a claim to mythopoetic status by including a tiresiaslike blind seer but mostly it is an empty recycling of the crow <>
the radical switch involves having the dead man avenging a son rather than a lover but otherwise it simply finds a different leatherclad fellow killing his own killers one by one and oh the time and energy exerted on finding creative methods of inflicting pain <>
the bill of fare in city of angels includes a hypodermic needle jammed up a nose a tattoo needle applied to the eyeball eyes gouged out and even a tortured crow dont worry no animals were harmed in the making of this film <>
its a resolutely ugly film director tim pope has put together heavy on gratuitous sm but light on any semblance of a point <>
sarah we assume this is the skatepunk from the first film all grown up serves only to give us the lovely mia kirshner to look at and pope appears far more concerned with serving up candlewaxonthenipples than creating characters <>
{} there are plenty of individual reasons to avoid city of angels though iggy pop makes an ideal villain for the crow since he looks like a corpse himself but its much simpler to explain why each category of potential viewer should stay away <>
if you did not see the first film you probably have no interest in a dark story of vengeance with plenty of unpleasantness <>
if you saw the first film and did not like it expect more of the same in city of angels only less compelling less artistic and more obsessed with music video theatrics <>
and if you saw the first film and did like it do the memory of brandon lee a great honor and do not let his death provide a producer with an excuse to build a franchise this awful on his grave <>

{} i think its fair to say that ive been looking forward to a film version of xmen for a while now somewhere in the neighborhood of years as a matter of fact <>
xmen was one of the first comic books i ever bought and it launched me on a love affair with the medium that abated only when as a college student i could no longer afford my habit <>
some readers may suspect that this history would lead me to go easy on an adolescent fanboy <>
personally i thought it would make me much tougher <>
after all a year wait can do something to ones expectations <>
i didnt think id settle for anything less than the kind of comic book adaptation you almost never see one that combines rousing heroic action with a solid story <>
{} to my joy and astonishment thats exactly what i got <>
xmen is not just a great comic book movie its actually a pretty good movie period <>
for those unfamiliar with the source material the xmen are mutants humans with unusual powers that manifest themselves during puberty <>
telepathic mutant professor charles xavier patrick stewart has dedicated himself to helping mutants learn to cope with their powers at his school for gifted youngsters mutants like retractable clawwielding wolverine hugh jackman and a teenager called rogue anna paquin who absorbs the life force of people she touches <>
xavier also has a powerful adversary in magneto ian mckellen who sees mutants as destined for superiority and who believes the mass of humanity fears and hates mutantkind <>
it seems magnetos perspective is justified when us senator robert kelly bruce davison begins advocating for mutants to register with the government <>
and when magneto and his brotherhood of mutants set in motion a plan to mutate all of humanity you can bet that a battle with xaviers xmen is not far off <>
{} the xmen universe has grown pretty unwieldy over the years but director bryan singer the usual suspects and his team of writers wisely keep the focus on a limited number of characters team leader cyclops james marsden telekinetic jean grey famke janssen and weather manipulator storm halle berry <>
even more wisely he focuses primarily on wolverine and his paternal relationship with the fragile frightened rogue <>
that choice not only gives the story an emotional anchor it gives plenty of screen time to xmens most intriguing character and easily its best performance <>
youve probably never seen australian actor hugh jackman before though he resembles a brawnier gary sinise but you will see him again because the guy has charisma to burn <>
jackman offers everything a fan could hope for in a portrayal of wolverine from the trademark muttonchops to the genuine sense of mystery and menace <>
if xmen had nothing else going for it but jackman it would still be worth seeing <>
{} the wonderful thing is that xmen does have more going for it <>
drawing on one of the comics best stories of the s xmen effectively uses the subtext of antimutant hysteria as a combination of red scare theres a great moment in a senate debate in which kelly waves around a list of names of known mutants racism and homophobia <>
it offers dozens of insider gags for the xmen faithful while avoiding the slavish devotion to every detail that can interfere in solid film storytelling <>
and just in case it matters to anyone it offers some of the kickassinest action scenes this side of the matrix <>
the climactic battle between the xmen and the brotherhood including shapeshifter mystique rebecca romijnstamos tongueflicker toad ray park and bonecrusher sabretooth tyler mane is simply superb <>
the fact that you dont have to wade through minutes of junk to get to it is a wonderful bonus <>
{} of course xmen has its flaws <>
theres not much for halle berry to do but look intense when her eyes go white which is probably all for the best given the incredible disappearing accent she occasionally employs <>
the script also doesnt do quite enough with turning magneto into a genuinely tragic villain especially given the amount of time devoted to his backstory in the prologue <>
its always tough for a film like xmen to lay the foundation while still delivering the goods so its inevitable that there are going to be some lulls and loose ends <>
i was startled however by how few there were <>
maybe my inner adolescent fanboy did emerge during xmen but it emerged because the film reminded me of the best the comic book had to offer as well as some of the best an action film can offer <>
i think it was worth the wait though i have a sneaking suspicion it wont be years before the xmen hit the screen again <>

{} in his last film s littleseen the gingerbread man robert altman took his unique perspective to the finer points of the legal systems workings in the american south <>
apparently he decided he hadnt yet explored it in all possible depth because hes back in dixie for cookies fortune <>
the regions easy rhythms and idiosyncracies seem to suit the filmmaker well and he seems to be having a heck of a good time with his visits there <>
cookies fortune finds altman laying down a blues jam of intertwining characters spiced with a deft dry comic touch into a surprising offbeat entertainment <>
{} the cookie of the title is eccentric matriarch jewel mae cookie orcutt patricia neal strongwilled inabitant of a holly springs mississippi manor with her black houseman willis charles s dutton <>
cookie is estranged from her only family in town nieces camille dixon glenn close and cora duvall julianne moore but that doesnt stop the overbearing camille from considering everything connected to her family her business <>
thats especially true when camille visits cookies home only to discover a scene which could potentially bring embarrassment to the family and contrives a story to cover it up <>
her story sets in motion a strange chain of events which finds innocent people jailed secrets revealed and plenty of wild turkey consumed <>
{} cookies fortune is probably most easily summarized as a southern spin on fargos tale of polite commonsense police investigation <>
but that doesnt entirely capture the films quirky rhythms <>
on the surface its the story of camilles manipulations of simpleminded cora of coras wildchild expatriate daughter emma liv tyler of everyone involved in the investigation at cookies estate providing glenn close with a grand showcase for a woman who turns her own life into a tennessee williams play <>
yet even as camilles plans begin to unravel cookies fortune is less about the suspense and tension of guilt exposed than it is about the pleasures of watching it meander to its inevitable conclusion <>
as it is in many altman films the plot wellconstructed as it is by anne rapp works best as a place for a handful of appealing performances to unfold <>
{} and there are certainly plenty of appealing performances <>
of which closes is only the most gaudy <>
charles s dutton wraps himself around williss goodnatured roguery giving the character a wellworn charm <>
ned beatty similarly entertains as the police chief little concerned with bythebook procedure among friends <>
matt malloy has a funny minor role as an overzealous investigator <>
even chris odonnell so often an attractive blank hole as an actor acquits himself well in the ideal role of a puppydogeagertoplease deputy <>
the only stumble comes from julianne moore who doesnt know quite what to do with cora whether to make her a simple naif or an even sadder case of a woman with a genuine developmental disability <>
fortunately shes a rare false note in altmans smooth orchestration <>
{} cookies fortune is the kind of unconventional narrative of lingering takes that may leave some viewers shifting in their seats waiting for the point of it all <>
for altman in this particular case taking the time to get to the point is actually part of the point <>
its a comedy of details dropped in almost offhandedly and others a hand literally caught in the cookie jar for instance underlined at just the right moment <>
it doesnt add up to all that much either as character study or as crime drama nor does it take the straightest path between any two points <>
its merely a lazy crazy consistently amusing diversion about a place where you only know the true measure of a man or a woman after youve gone fishing together <>
its a place altman might consider visiting more often <>

{} i knew i was in trouble in the beverly hillbillies when joke involved stomping a bear in the groin <>
joke covered the expulsion of bodily gasses <>
the portion of the audience that was years old either chronologically or intellectually howled with delight <>
i merely sat in astonished silence and prepared for a very long ninety minutes <>
{} the film version of the beverly hillbillies doesnt stray far from the premise of the television series <>
jed clampett jim varney stumbles upon a billion dollar reservoir of crude oil while hunting in arkansas then decides to move to california with spunky daughter elly may erika eleniak irrascible granny cloris leachman and lunkhead nephew jethro diedrich bader <>
the reason for the move widower jed wants to find a new wife and educate tomboyish elly may in the ways of a refined woman <>
in beverly hills jed entrusts his fortune to bank president milburn drysdale dabney coleman and his unctuous assistant miss jane hathaway lily tomlin <>
meanwhile bank toady tyler rob schneider and his golddigging girlfriend laura lea thompson hatch a plan to have laura pose as a french governess for elly may insinuating herself into the clampetts good graces as well as their checkbook <>
{} the real star of the beverly hillbillies is casting director glenn daniels who has put together about as perfect a physical match for the cast of the series as i could imagine <>
simply admiring cloris leachmans remarkable resemblance to the late irene ryan was enough to inspire me to grant hillbillies about ten minutes of good will <>
unfortunately that turned out to be nine minutes too much <>
as eager as the performers seem to be to throw themselves into their roles theyre just not given anything remotely interesting to do <>
{} congratulate lawrence konner and mark rosenthal who receive story and coscreenwriting credit for pulling off a challenging task coming up with a script even more pedestrian than their work in for love or money <>
they aim their jokes so far below the belt that they usually end up somewhere around the ankles <>
the addams family approach is clearly in evidence here namely to come up with a gauzethin story then turn the characters loose to ham it up in comic strip fashion <>
the beverly hillbillies maintains a fairly consistent pattern of setupsetupgag setupsetupgag where you can see hear and smell every one coming from several miles away <>
the series ran for ten years theres just not much new ground to cover in the rednecks among the ritzy department <>
its therefore not much of a surprise that the few really fresh and funny moments dont involve the hillbillies at all watch instead if watch you must for some sharp jabs at beverly hills high school students <>
these laughs are so rare i wont spoil them by name <>
{} as in her hit waynes world director penelope spheeris seems to wallow in intertextuality we get references to jeopardy peoples court barnaby jones and deliverance just to name a few and none of them are funny <>
spheeris seems to be making the mistaken assumption that referentiality is funny in its own right regardless of context forgetting that waynes world worked because it was about the pop culture awareness of the twentysomethings <>
theres none of that goofy selfawareness in the beverly hillbillies just a plodding almost smug conviction that it will be a hit no matter what kind of garbage they throw at the audience <>
it would be nice to see them proved wrong <>
{} sadly the beverly hillbillies seems destined to attract the same audience that made the addams family a hit a combination of nostalgic parents and easilyamused kids <>
for nostalgia watch the series in syndicated reruns for free for the kids just give them a good book theyll thank you for it later <>

{} i dont think theres a time idle hands could have been released that would have made it a good film but its unfortunate release at this particular time makes it seem even more rancid <>
in the wake of the april st shootings at littleton colorados columbine high school pundits and politicians have been holding forth on the desensitizing effects of violence in our popular culture particularly that which is aimed at teenagers <>
the hardcore first amendment advocate in me has approached most of this talk as conservative rabble rousing but theres no defending something as brutally wrongheaded as idle hands <>
if this is what contemporary adolescents want to see in the movies we really are in trouble <>
{} the plot such as it is centers on a yearold named anton tobias devon sawa whose lifes goal is to lay around watching t v and getting stoned with his buddies mick seth green and pnub elden henson <>
unfortunately for anton the devil will find work for idle hands to do as a malevolent spirit takes possession of his right hand and forces him to kill his parents mick and pnub <>
then mick and pnub return from the dead to provide wacky comic relief convincing a freakedout anton that extreme measures are required <>
that involves removing the offending appendage leaving five demonic digits free to wreak havoc at antons high school halloween dance <>
{} even on its most basic level idle hands is either idiotic or pandering when it isnt both <>
vivica a fox appears as a druid priestess following the handpossessing spirits trail of mayhem perhaps as some sort of misguided spoof of buffy the vampire slayer <>
the nubile lead actress jessica alba falls instantly for the slackerly anton naturally even finding his wayward hand kinky <>
naked breasts appear because well thats what naked breasts do in teenoriented films <>
the problemsolving powers of marijuana are lauded to the heavens <>
mick and pnub are the only two victims of antons to return from the grave even the internal logic of the films supernatural universe is fuzzy only to invite comparisons to another horror comedy john landis an american werewolf in london <>
and the gore it raineth down like waters from the heavens <>
only seth green with his wry delivery offers a moments entertainment amidst the stupidity <>
{} ill head off the rebuttals of the dude relax its just a movie contingent at the proverbial pass yes its supposed to be a horror comedy with its absurd excesses probably intentional to a certain extent <>
the problem is that the horror and the comedy are not combined with a knowing wink but sequenced in a disconcerting fashion <>
first someone is killed in a horrific manner then someone makes a joke about the murder <>
the numbing nonchalance of the commentary lends credence to the harshest condemnations of media violence in this film the ridicule isnt directed at the conventions of horror films but at the deaths of teenagers <>
when characters in the film gather at a makeshift memorial to two of antons victims its hard to suppress a shudder when images of columbine high school are still so fresh in our minds <>
{} of course its a freakish coincidence that idle hands appears as it does in the wake of that tragedy and that any of the films images bring it to mind <>
its harder to ignore turning straightforward carnage into comedy <>
im not sure whether idle hands could have redeemed itself if it actually had made a statement about the potential destructiveness of its protagonists lives of sloth instead of celebrating same but at least that would have been a nod to something beyond its audiences most antisocial tendencies <>
this film is a bad idea at an even worse time little more than fuel for the fires of righteous indignation which unfortunately are seeming a bit more righteous all the time <>

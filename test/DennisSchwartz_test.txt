{} this buster keaton wannabe movie is supposedly a comedyromance about an inept morose oslo mailman roy skjaerstad who is not respected by his fellow workers and shows he is not satisfied with his job somehow taking this frustration out by not delivering heaps of mail which he dumps out regularly at some railroad underpass and by steaming open other letters and reading them <>
he is a sleaze a frequenter of porn book shops and lowlife night spots <>
his life is a dreary loveless mess <>
{} as if all that is not bad enough certainly grounds for dismissal from the post office someone who would upset me if he was my mailman but to top that off he is also a voyeur finding the keys to a deaf she wears a hearing aid womans apartment that she left in the mailbox and using the key to enter her apartment when she is at work at her dry cleaning job to go through her things and steal a photograph of her <>
it seems he finds her attractive but doesnt know how to get to tell her this <>
she is played in a lowkey manner by andrine saether line <>
{} this film is noted for showing the slum side to beautiful oslo where we see crime ugly buildings the subway and problems outsiders do not associate with this peaceful and scenic country <>
the crime we see is roy being robbed of his mailbag but his strap gets caught and he cant even get robbed properly later on saying he would have gladly given up the bag and avoided the beating the three muggers gave him that hospitalized him and made him out to be a postal hero for not wanting to give up the bag <>
the film spends most of the first half of the movie showing him to be a screw off everything he touches he fouls up a complete loser there is a long tradition of hollywood comedians who have exploited that avenue of comedy <>
his comic effect is a deadpan expression that absorbs all criticism that comes his way <>
his fellow postal workers rag him about what he is good for and a lady postal worker who wants to stick up for him can only say that he is a good walker which causes a round of snickers from the postal workers ragging him <>
what is funny is the way he looks at us as he looks at the camera showing us his hurt feelings and pathetic nature emphasizing to us that he is a natural screw up <>
{} but the picture has darker ulterior motives than that it will chuck out all the work it did setting up the film as a fluff piece of comedy and go for the criminal aspects to the story a decision that has to change how we approach seeing this film we can no longer be content to relax laughing at this inept mailman we have to now see how he handles himself under fire while the director also tries to bring romance into the story <>
{} the romance that comes to this film comes in a surprising way as roy is trapped in lines apartment when she comes home unexpectedly and he watches her nude as she goes to take a bath but what she is really doing is committing suicide <>
roy saves her by reviving her and calling for an ambulance leaving the house before she knows that it was him that saved her <>
there is a dark side to her that is now disclosed she is involved with a strongarm thug georg per who beat a security guard senseless in a robbery and gave line the money to hold for them <>
{} as far as i am concerned the film loses track of what it is capable of doing at this point of the story and it becomes a different film where one contrived situation after another occurs to keep the story suspenseful with the buffoonlike georg menacing roy <>
roy is now the subject of a film that doesnt know if it wants to be viewed as a suspense or romance yarn or just as a plain comedy <>
roy still acts with the same deadpan expression as a result everything becomes muddled and ridiculous <>
the laugh situations seem forced the romance absurd and the suspense unreal <>
{} at best i found this film to be a modest effort at comedy that results in a modest film barely being less than annoying but redeemed by showing me the darker side of oslo a side that i have not seen before on screen <>
so i think that this first time director who is guilty of trying to come up with too many different twists to the story and by relying on a hero to carry the film who is not very likable and a story line that is very thin has defeated the comic efforts that he was successful with during the first part of the film but by the end of the film wears down to a barely passable effort at comedy <>

{} just killing time four female temps become workplace friends as they try and cope with work and life in this disarmingly subtle movie that seems to grow more and more metaphysical by the minute <>
these temps are looking for something permanent in their lives <>
each is insecure and unhappy <>
they are looking for a way out of this rat trap <>
{} toni is introspective and passive <>
parker is perky and rebellious <>
she is very mischievous and depressed because she is not able to fulfill her career ambitions <>
lisa dreams about stardom she is living in a fantasy world <>
alanna is in a mental stupor obliviously going into a marriage that has inherent danger signs to it <>
the dullness and pettiness of office life matches their real life situations <>
{} the plot develops around how tenuous such office friendships can be and how deathlike is the atmosphere they work in and how frighteningly transient everything seems to be <>
it was eerie to watch everything break down for these girls their hopes friendships and selfesteem <>
and when it was the temps who were suspected of some office thievery they see for themselves how far down the ladder others in the workplace really perceive them <>
{} in the end toni comes off the best gaining the most from her experiences <>
she realizes that she should have spoken up when parker was in trouble that it is important for the girls to stick together <>
{} their alienation is a national problem for both men and women <>
that society can be repressive and authoritarian is still true today as this film encourages you to see and think about what has really changed after all the womens lib movement agendas and all the other changes in the workplace that have been accomplished especially for women and if these changes have really made life better for them <>
{} i was most interested in the parker character because of her spunkiness and her awkward attempts to form real friendships as they all seemed to be met with some disappointment and the veneer she chooses to hide behind is so easy to pull off her as a false mask as she is the one who gets hit the hardest getting canned from a job that she only has contempt for and she is the one who seems the most alone in the end she does not seem to have support from any of the following parents lovers friends or even a roommate who is always away <>
she seems to be the one who in actuality is the least able to take care of herself which is in sharp contrast to how she conducted herself in the beginning of the film and toni of all people realizes this and becomes the only one who comes to her aid even if it is done indirectly it is she who writes a job recommendation for her when parkers world has completely crashed and she does this by using the guile she evidently picked up from parker <>
{} a gem of a small movie <>
adeptly uncovering the need for positive relationships and the need for solidarity in a hostile workplace which might as well be a metaphor for how to handle yourself in the world <>
the inability of the girls to function in this modern society is punctuated by their need to question what they are doing and their need to belong to something that makes sense to them <>
and even though no smug answers were given as how to accomplish this one does have choices at least you can start by facing up to yourself and your situation and not just marking time and staying put on a job that bores you <>
this movie definitively brought up a topic a lot of people are concerned about and even if it said it in a low voice its message can be heard above the idle chatter in the office if you are tuned in to the right cubicle <>

{} by the title of the film you know that betrayal is part of the storyline and it is in this hip attempt at neonoir and a quentin tarantino type of film using the colorful city of new orleans as background for its murder and kidnapping tale <>
two lowlevel criminals junior armstrong simon bakerdenny and coco chavez carla gugino and a con artist lizard browning gil bellows decide to go bigtime and hire a psychotic muscleman ruben til to join their kidnapping team for the taking of ben dyson greg a billionaire bill gates type of a clone who is a computer manufacturer <>
they end up holding him for a four million dollar ransom when they violently break through his home security system to nab him <>
{} one snag in the operation develops a lady appears in the hallway of dysons apartment and is shot by coco as the lady stares right at her <>
it turns out that she is the wife of senator hornbeck hal holbrook <>
this becomes a highprofile case and calls for a dual investigation of federal the kidnapping part and the local police the murder <>
{} two english actors are cast as american police who try their hand at a southern accent and fail to be convincing <>
one is the head of the entire investigation fbi agent sadie hawkins emma and the other is local homicide detective lieutenant david friedman rickman <>
he whines about having a woman above him in authority and they talk freely about sexual things as they introduce themselves to each other <>
when his police chief browne assigns him to investigate the wife of the senators death he gripes about that telling his chief that this is another detectives case <>
{} when hornbeck threatens friedman insisting that he get off the case and fails to assist him after being informed by the detective that his wife is having an affair with dyson the detective suspects that this is no ordinary kidnapping for ransom and somehow or other the powerful senator is involved in it <>
the detective will go against police orders and continue to investigate on his own <>
{} as a nervous accountant from dysons firm the one who will hand over the ransom money to the kidnapers goes through the phone drill of where to drop the money off the cops follow along and have some forced conversations on the way to stir up some humor in this poorly characterized and acted script that will rely on trick plots and a series of betrayals to tell its very forgetable story <>
one of the cop conversations mimics many of the more recent neonoir genre films in slickness as hawkins is reading jim thompsons crime novel the killer inside me which he has already read and greatly admires with the main thrust from that conversation being that the book says there is only one plot in a murder mystery and that nothing is what it seems <>
{} while coco is holding dyson hostage and lizard is on the phone with the accountant ruben and junior are waiting by the train tracks for the ransom money <>
in her conversation with the arrogant computer whiz she discovers that he is having an affair with the senators wife and it dawns on her suddenly that she is being setup by her boyfriend junior <>
when the senator orders his man to kill dyson and some of the police seem to be in on the plot the story goes overthe edge <>
{} coco the femme fatale and sex pot and the one through whom we follow the story becomes human again and prevents dyson from being executed <>
{} everything gets wrapped up in a nice bundle by the films end coco even gets her vengence as seen in the epilogue by meeting junior on margarita island months later and taking care of business <>
{} there was nothing fresh about the plot <>
the characters ranged from being obnoxious to being miscast though if one wished to a case could be made that carla gugino exuded some charm and sex appeal into the film <>
there was some inventiveness in all the plot twists but the effort wasnt worth it <>
the storyline and plot twists could not hold up to scrutiny anyway <>
somehow this film for the first time director managed to have some entertainment value in its glossy feel and arduous attempt to keep one guessing at what will happen next that is if you werent turned off by then by how hip it tried to be as it was a little too cool for its own good and the story suffered because there was no meaning to what was happening it all seemed like a pointless exercise <>

{} a melodramatic noir film with location shots in the caribbean <>
mike cormack john payne is a former assistant district attorney who after his fiancee dumps him to marry another man develops a drinking problem and is currently employed as a bouncer in a las vegas casino the blue diamond <>
while there he receives an odd proposition from a wheelchair bound criminal barzland francis l sullivan played by him with sydney greenstreetlike panache <>
he offers cormack to tell him where a missing ruby that is owed to him can be located mentioning that it vanished in a plane crash in the caribbean <>
the reason cormack is picked for this job is that the pilot involved in the smuggling operation eduardo picerni is the one who married janet martin mary murphy the beautiful woman whom cormack was engaged to and barzland figures he can get close to janet to get the info he needs to recover the gem <>
{} the film is told in flashbackstyle with a voiceover from the worldweary cormack filling us in on the details of what happened to him during the last crucial week of his life <>
as the opening credits go rolling by we see barzland shoot cormack and when cormack wakes up in the hospital operating room after surgery the police are questioning him and in particular are asking him about his relationship with janet <>
{} the operation symbolizes that the crestfallen cormack is now healed and sees things clearly as tells about his trip to the caribbean where he meets janet and gets fooled by her lies again <>

he will later learn from janet that her husband is innocent that it was she who toyed around with the fuel gauge but her husband took the blame for it <>
{} when cormack questions a cockfighter about the ruby he is mysteriously killed as is the housekeeper miguel cabal who works for mrs martin <>

after being locked up by barzland cormack escapes and has to throw one of barzlands henchmen szab to the alligators <>
as a result of cormacks short stay on the island there are three dead <>
{} why cormack doesnt leave is what makes him a typical noir icon <>
he offers three reasons for staying put he has fallen for janet again <>
he wants to earn <>
he wants to know who killed the cockfighter <>
{} things come to a climax when he meets another sleazy friend of janets paul armand moss a merchant and they concoct a plan of prison escape for eduardo <>
cormack goes along with the plan but is surprised that when he tries to get eduardo to escape with him he wont go telling cormack that his wife cant be trusted that she only wants him out of prison to kill him and get a insurance policy he has on him and he is positive that she has informed the police already who will only shoot him if he leaves <>

{} i felt like i was being onelined to a loving death in this elegant oscar wilde comedydrama costume play turned movie and i must confess i enjoyed every bit of the intelligence and the wit and the frivality of it as this tremendous ensemble cast fired away with a continuous volley of epigrams <>
it is a modern play even though it is one that was written in the last century for an audience that was more or less reflective of the characters portrayed on stage <>
for the elite audience that attended the play oscar wilde after mocking the english nobility would at least leave them with a thinly disguised compliment by telling them no one can be ideal <>
the film was put to screen by the manipulative wizardry of miramax shakespeare in love the wings of the dove who know from the success of some of their recent films quite well how to popularize an already popular literary work by broadening its emotional appeal <>
they gave the audiences what they wanted a film that has a romantic heart in it and is not just hilariously flippant and they should be commended for improving an imperfect but successful play <>
it rarely happens when a commercial venture turns out to critically improve a work of so called art so when it does happen it should be shouted from the highest mountain peaks <>
{} even before the film grandly opens at the party of the ideal husband sir robert chiltern jeremy northam and his loving victorian wife the beautiful and the suffragetteminded lady gertrude chiltern cate blanchett we will meet all the main players and be introduced to some of their mannerisms <>
then we tune into the real hero of the movie the one whom i found it easiest to relate to the slothful and cynical true voice of oscar wilde for the film the rakish lord goring rupert everett who tells his loyal servant phipps peter vaughan to love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance <>
and while he is being delivered his morning paper a naked woman is in his bed <>
he will then read aloud an item in the paper about the upcoming party followed by the title on screen the london season where people are looking for husbands or hiding from them <>
this now takes us seamlessly into the park where the shrewd mrs laura cheveley julianne moore is in a carriage with the haughty lady markby lindsay duncan as they come upon gertrude and we immediately see that there is some friction between laura and gertrude and that lady markby feels proud that she can arrange for her visiting friend from vienna to be invited to the party she so badly wanted to attend <>
{} immediately at the party the idyllic love bubble of the chilterns is burst by the treacherous mrs cheveley the former lover of lord goring who meets with the righteously honest politician on the rise sir robert in order to blackmail him into supporting an argentinean canal scheme she has invested a great deal of her money in <>
sir robert has already said in parliament that he regards that scheme as a swindle <>
she threatens to reveal a letter he wrote her years ago that gave inside info on the suez canal to an austrian baron before the government announced its intentions <>
sir robert if he doesnt change his opinion risks losing his wife if the letter is given to the press and risks losing his credibility with the public if he supports the canal <>
his best friend lord goring acts as the liaison trying to prevent the chilterns from breaking up <>
he is also having an innocently romantic relationship with sir roberts sister lady mabel minnie driver <>
{} everything is thoroughly enjoyable and agreeable about this wonderfully delightful work of subtle wit and brilliant dialogue <>
rupert everett stands out as a sheer delight in a cast that is almost perfect julianne moore could have been a tad more sinister <>
everetts role is one that he relishes in as he says of himself i love talking about nothing its the only thing i know anything about <>
minnie driver is simply bubbling over with charm and wit to match his <>
their flirtations are one of dueling wits with amusing lunges and enough doubleentendres to get through any intellectual armor worn <>
it is film laced with political blackmail an incriminating letter mixup in identities questions about friendship and loyalty money as a means to an end sex as a weapon for marriage the machinations of politics scorned at a potential tabloid scandal in the horizon and sanctimonious characters fighting to avoid being toppled <>
even the minor players were perfectly cast magnified by the performance of john wood as earl of caversham lord gorings stuffy father who is always lecturing him and trying to get him married <>
{} there are so many witty phrases to revel in but my favorite one is when lord goring says morality is only for those you dont like <>
writerdirector oliver parker othello has created a lighthearted film for all audiences who love the spoken word as if it were a treasure and who find the intrigues of high society to be invigorating <>

{} an excrutiatingly long the film runs minutes adaptation of pulitizer prize winning author toni morrisons book based on the true story of runaway slave margaret garner <>
the film version centers around the psychological problems a former single parent slave named sethe oprah has as she tries to live her life as a free person <>
i have not read the book but as others who read the book have commented this is a very difficult work to bring to film because the authors words are so literary imaginative and poetic such works have in the past resulted in poorly shot films <>
that is not the case here <>
toni morrison has said that she is very pleased with the outcome of the film <>
demme has sort of solved the literary problem by making this film into a ghost story as the strong visualizations are used as metaphors for the inhumanity of slavery and the lasting impressions it stamps on the minds of the victims <>
there can be no doubt of how brutal a system slavery is <>
and demme uses images such as a dog having his eyes gauged out and subliminally invective flashbacks of slaves being hung and whipped to point out the psychological scars that remain upon the people who lived through this very dark period of americas history <>
and these scars and hatreds of that period are still with present day america as it wrestles with its past and the deep racial divisions it has created <>
{} the frightening and intense emotional mood this film sets is appropriate for the seriousness of the issues it brings to the table and the deprivation it causes in the country cannot be minimized in any degree which it isnt here <>
this is an honest picture ever faithful to the books author and the subject matter <>
but there were definite flaws in this film that detracted from it such as the poor editing and pace of the film <>
the first and middle parts of the film dragged on for too long as it just failed to hold ones attention to the story for long periods of time <>
and it was also shot for the most part in shadowy night colors making the dark screen unpleasant to watch <>
{} what was emotionally moving about the film were its very striking visualizations such as the use of the haunted house to make certain that slavery is understood as a haunting experience that stays with people who experienced it and that its ills may be deemed permanent for those who cant exorcize the demons slavery has thrust onto the land <>
the haunted house is scary its apparition of the baby that sethe oprah had killed rather than return her to slavery in sweet home indicates how the hope for the negro is in the new generation the old can just hope to survive and be free <>
the ghost scenes in sethes house were strong enough messages to scare away any company she might want to have <>
{} but i was not crazy about the casting of oprah in the major role of the film she was certainly adequate for the part there was a stoic strength about her that was needed in her performance and she provided that but she did not show a deep enough range of emotions that a more accomplished actress would have shown <>
when danny glover paul d was on screen the film had an electricity to it <>
but when oprah was on screen without him the film lagged <>
{} when reminiscing with sethe about their slave days at sweet home paul d has this great line to sum up his slave days it was not sweet and it was not home <>
{} the strength of the film lies in the energy it picks up in its final scenes as the story clearly came together and all the images throughout the film began to add up and make sense and it was able to leave an indelible mark on the viewer that lasts long after seeing the film in fact the film gets better when you start thinking about it long after you have seen the film and only unique visionary pictures are capable of doing that <>
{} the film opens after showing the simple grave with only the word beloved marked on it <>
sethe is living in an old broken down house in the outskirts of cincinnatti in eight years after the civil war freed the slaves <>
she lives there with her teenage daughter denver kimberly her two sons having run away from this haunted house and sad life <>
denver clings to sethe being too afraid to venture out of the immediate area of the house by herself <>
that she evolves as the story moves on and learns how to take care of herself is one of the refreshing surprises that comes about as kimberleys performance is very gratifying and touching to behold especially to see how she matures and grows up from her very weak stature in life <>
she becomes the real heroine of the story <>
{} sethe and denver have learned to live with what they have when paul d glover shows up at their house <>
he has not seen her since they escaped from slavery in kentucky years ago <>
he moves in and they become family but the ghost in the house becomes agitated by this and reappears in an otherworldly girl named beloved thandie who is taken in by sethe <>
by having beloved live with her sethes contented life can no longer be and the bad memories resurface as the ghost that is in beloved is clearly the young girl sethe once killed <>
{} what unfolds is the coming to grips with the spectre of slavery and the misery it caused to sethe as she is forced to relive the sin she has done <>
beloveds performance is eerie and painstaking i wouldnt call it a great performance <>
but it is gutwrenching to watch how weird she behaves drooling and stuffing food in her mouth like an animal as sethe doesnt know how to reach her and love her yet feels remorseful about her <>
she looks at her as if she was her own daughter so it is not surprising when she says that she would do the same thing again if she had to choose between slavery and a young girls life <>
one of the most powerful lines in the film is when the tenderskinned beloved who would have been the same age as sethes beloved if she were alive says to her why you have me why you leave me <>
{} the other powerful woman in the story is baby suggs beah richards who is sethes motherinlaw a spiritual healer of the negroes whose performance is only too brief in the film she brings life to the film that is in desperate need of revitalization during its many dull lapses <>
but fortunately demme is able to show the natural beauty of where they live and the warmth and strength of the afroamericans and their ability to stick together to help one another in times of despair this is especially so with the women folk who turned to jesus for strength as they are shown praying with baby suggs <>
{} when sethe is ready to face up to the realities and misdeeds slavery does to human beings her vitality improves for awhile as she exclaims to paul d feel how it feels to be a colored woman roaming the roads with anything god made liable to jump on you feel that <>
{} i still think that i should have read the book to really feel what that is even if the film was credible enough i imagine the book is that much more pertinent and that much more powerful than this very interesting and intelligent film that views slavery in an unforgettable way perhaps in a way that audiences have not visualized the evil consequences of slavery before seeing this film <>

[17110/c+]
{} what we have is a very cleverly done film that is in it for the boxoffice and as an entertainment only film and it should accomplish both aims at least entertainment wise it is firstrate <>
it is a good mindless violent flick for americans to take their mind off the more serious things occuring at the time this movie opened such as the political scandal and impeachment hearings involving our prez and his lady intern and you know how serious that stuff was <>
{} to get into the spirit of the film you must suspend your belief in logic and accept this as a hero fantasy story with the hero being a tainted one basically fighting for his own pride and perverted sense of ethics as he figures his life is worth that being the figure he is owed by his partner in crime val gregg a sadomasochist with no redeeming human qualities who along with porter mel has robbed an oriental crime family to get the unsavory dough before he doublecrossed porter and supposedly had him killed <>
but do remember the bad hero is not all that bad he is mel the charming hero of countless adventure films a guy who is full of good looks and charm someone audiences love to like and will plunk down their money to see his films in huge numbers <>
he also does the voiceover ala noir style in a deep laconic voice you know like a sam spade would do it <>
the voiceover reassured me that he will live through the film <>
thats good because knowing him he will be in every scene of this flick and therefore im assured that i will be getting my moneys worth of mel <>
you see i dont really care what happens to his character in this flick per se since he is as unreal as the ones you find in the cartoons <>
what i care about is being entertained by golly golly golly gee <>
{} payback rips off the way a noir film is shot and looks or maybe in a certain sense pays it homage and does it with pizzazz <>
the big city it chooses for its locale is chicago with its tall buildings and el trains adding a dark shade to its story <>
the only thing it fails to pick up from those great bw films mood pieces of edginess from the s and s is that their heroes were really underdogs they were fighting the system not out for their own ends and vanity only <>
this little difference is easy to ignore but it is bothersome when i see how close mel came to sniffing out the essence of a noir film <>
but im glad to report ever so close but no cigar tough guy <>
you just cant imitate that secret ingredient without being into the real thing <>
so take your clams you will extract from the outfit and enjoy that money with the reformed whore with a heart of mush rosie maria you both deserve it <>
you were both great to look at on screen you played your hands well and most importantly i enjoyed the film it had a lightness to it that made it very appealing <>
{} needless to say there was not much to the plot for this stylish film but for those of you who want to know the story line this is a pure revenge film <>
porter after being setup by his junkie wife lynn deborah and val who needs a to square things with the outfit and get back into the organization where he can really get good money and protection from the mob <>
the action scenes of this heist are super <>
porter notices that the gang is not wearing their seat belts so on their rounds when they are carrying the loot he crashes headon to them killing them and then robbing them of the loot <>
then val does his doublecross as porters wife shoots her hubby taking all the money which happens to be <>
that is why our hero insists on only getting back the sum he believes he is ethically owed for the work he did <>
this gag lends a much welcomed humor to what could have been just a pointless actioner <>
at least the filmmakers are having fun with this one and it shows <>
{} for the remainder of this slick film porter is either getting beat up or doing the beatings himself <>
in between there are assorted killings the traditional way with a heater <>
but there is also a car full of mobsters getting blown up and some get blown up via the phone <>
there is plenty of action so dont worry you dont have to think of anything when you are watching this flick everything moves at breakneck speed <>
a duo of corrupt cops get into the act one black the other white very political correct i must say <>
these filmmakers have a great eye for detail <>
and there is a sleaze ball drug dealer paymer the one who sells bad heroin to porters dear wife <>
he turns out to be the man porter uses to contact val upon his return from the dead <>
then there is the oriental gang and their interest turns to porter when they are tipped off that he robbed them <>
so allinall you have a lot of good action scenes going down a lot of funny oneliners i laughed out loud when porter said if i was any dumber i would have become a cop you see porter is acting very dumb going after the mob and its big bosses kristofferson coburn and devane <>
i especially liked seeing devane he is a throwback to the old noir foils <>
there is also an homage scene or a rip off which ever you prefer it doesnt matter to me when porter rips the earring off a drug dealers ear taking a chunk of his ear with it <>
you cant help remembering roman polansky did that in chinatown a true modern noir film a film that caught the essence of that genre <>
{} the filmmakers are first time director and former screen writer of l a confidential brian helgeland <>
the film is based on a novel the hunter by richard stark <>
the film works for all the above reasons and most of all it works because mel is great for the part <>

{} in an outdoor phone booth in the industrial city of bristol england someone dressed in a trenchcoat is asking for ransom money for a young boy kidnapped from an elite school <>
on the receiving end of that call are the childs parents telling the kidnappers that they are not wealthy that there has been a mistake you have kidnapped someone who doesnt have the kind of money most who attend that school have <>
the police are in the boys house with superintendent hume peter madden in charge monitoring the call hoping to keep the kidnapper on the phone for an extended period of time so that they can trace the call <>
so begins a film that is more interested in studying the nature of someone who could commit such a crime and have it escalate to a murder than in keeping the film suspenseful by having the audience guess who did it <>
{} mr hopta dan duryea is the american who lives next door to a cat fancier mrs marotta isa miranda and is cheerfully listening to her complain about one of her neighbors who did not appreciate it that her cats got loose and went onto his property <>
she is friendly with the gregarious and handy mr hopta who has fixed many of her broken appliances for free something she really appreciates since she cant afford to buy new ones or pay to get the broken ones fixed <>
he chastises her for not calling her niece trudy jean over a little argument they had and when she tells him that she cant because she doesnt have the money he generously gives her the coins to make the call <>
{} meanwhile the police have just discovered the childs body in the woods and are looking for any lead they can get on this murder case <>
the boys parents are distraught with the news and the father feels he cant stay on the line with the caller if he should call again and keep him talking as the police request because he is too weak from the ordeal <>
the police insist that this is their best shot at getting the killer <>
so when the kidnapper calls again demanding money he manages to keep the caller on the line until they trace the call but he cant help it any more and blurts out in anger why did you kill my boy <>
{} at the phone booth the italian lady drops the change hopta gave her and is on the ground picking up the coins when the caller of the phone that the police traced comes rushing out of the phone booth <>
she notices only their brown shoes and pants but fails to look up and see that it is mrs hopta gwen <>
while inside the booth in the middle of her conversation with trudy the police frighten her by pulling her away from the phone and taking her down to the police station where she is cleared of the crime but is being questioned by superintendent hume as a possible witness <>
{} mrs marotta volunteers to act as bait to catch the murderer feeling sorry that a little boy was killed and she failed to be of help in identifying the killer <>
she tells the police that her life isnt that valuable that she would like to do something to help even if what she is doing is dangerous <>
but the police nix that offer saying it is unfair to put her in such danger <>
{} determined to get the killer on her way out of the police station this very proud woman who even refuses the police offer of a ride home tells the newsmen waiting there that she saw what the killer looked like <>
the police have no choice now but to protect her and wait for the killer to strike <>
as an added precaution to their street security they place a man inside her house to watch her detective sergeant connor barry warren <>

{} not satisfied that hes home free from the crime hopta tells his wife that it is strange that mrs m didnt recognize you it could only mean that she didnt see you and that this is a police trap as he decides to go over there and check up on what is going on <>
{} convinced that mrs m saw something and might later on recall it and link him to the crime hopta tells his anguished wife i better kill her and make sure <>
this is the pivotal scene of this bw noir film as hopta goes completely over the edge and cannot be looked upon any more as just a pathetic loser who keeps making mistakes <>
he is now a dangerous murderer willing to kill again even if it is his neighbor that he admittedly likes and not some anonymous person like the boy he accidently killed <>
{} what keeps the film chilling is dan duryea as the friendly nextdoor neighbor who is so psychologically warped yet doesnt overtly show it <>
he brings his wife along on the nightmare he is having even though he dearly loves her <>
to watch him ingratiate himself with the kindly older neighbor and all the time he is planning to poison her and when that doesnt work to strangle her makes for a frightening character portrayal of someone you think you know but you dont <>
duryea is so good at acting out a part like this with just the right balance of charm controlled madness and hubris until at the end of the film he completely snaps singing old military songs as the police arrest him and his wife is accidently poisoned to death and is seen lying on the kitchen floor <>

{} the world is a hard place is the theme that runs through sayles well thoughtout political film about a capable upperclass but naive doctor from the city of some hypothetical latin american country <>
the part of the doctor is played by the distinguished looking whitehaired argentinean luppi <>
the doctor has trained some students to be doctors in the remote mountainous areas where the indians live under the auspicies of a specially funded program <>
he hasnt heard from them since they left and is now anxious to visit them on his vacation and see how they are doing before he retires <>
he takes his fancy wheeler and makes the difficult trek to this impoverished region in order to see what his legacy will be <>
he is concerned about leaving a legacy before he dies <>
he is filled with pride about his accomplishments but this pride turns to agony as he slowly realizes that all the doctors he has trained have been assassinated and that he has sent them to their deaths by not preparing them for the realities of their job <>
{} on his journey to find the political truth the doctor picks up some travelling companions who in turn add their tales of woe to the horrors of living in such a bad political climate <>
from the orphan boy dan he meets in the starving indian village he learns how little the people have how ruthless both the army which is made up of mostly indian soldiers and the guerillas are <>
these are the men with guns they will kill anyone whether they have a reason to or not <>
the white plantation owners are the exploiters of the people keeping them working at unreasonably low wages <>
{} the boy turns out to be useful to the doctor because he speaks the native language and he knows how to find his way in spots where there are no visible roads <>
the army deserter delgado robs the doctor and then kidnaps him and through the use of flashbacks we see how he participated as a medic in the army in violence and murder of the villagers <>
{} a priest hitches a ride and tells his story of losing faith while working with the villagers and no longer considers himself a priest <>
he does not see what good religion can do in such a repressive area as the doctor questions him and states that a person must believe in something <>
{} and finally a mute young lady who has been raped by the soldiers and subsequently has stopped speaking comes along with them hoping to find a secure place to live <>
{} a talkative american couple mandy and kathryn interested in the ancient civilization of this country but unable to comprehend what is going down for the current indians living here strike a chord for all those who should see what is taking place but cant and this is because they cant face what is right in front of them but because they are living charmed lives they will return to their country unscathed by all the atrocities around them <>
{} the doctor is the eyes and ears for what is going on <>
his slow but steady transformation into political awareness is the most reassuring omen sent out in this nondidactic straight forward ambitious project of sayles <>
he does not glorify the indians the ones who are the most cruelly treated <>
he shows how unopen and hostile they can be to visitors and how when given a chance to get a better life they will do anything to escape even kill their own people <>
the strength that comes from such a story is in the telling of it and the powerful images presented <>
the problem with all this is that since no specific country was named it must mean that sayles considers this to be a universal problem and that makes the problem gigantic with no one to be specifically blamed especially since these kind of human abuses have been going on for ages it becomes difficult to zero in on what can be done to prevent such happenings <>
the other problem is that one can get the feeling that there reaches a point where one feels he is being manipulated that there is so little that can be done by individuals alone that governments have to be held accountable for their actions and people have to be aware of what their governments are doing even if most of all people have to learn how to help themselves <>
{} this is a very strong independent minded picture that chooses to tell a very difficult story one that not many people will take comfort in <>
but the question arises as to how the message of such despair will get out to people who are so far removed from that isolated part of the world <>
it seems that this film might have some influence but there is little that individuals who are not from that region can do as proof we have just to look at the terrors faced by those in this film who tried to help <>

{} as good as it gets is a formula driven sitcom with nothing new added in the way of being fresh stuff except from the charms emanating from its characters with the film relying mainly on the comic antics of jack nicholson melvin udall to carry the ball as an obnoxious curmudgeon who plays this successful and wealthy writer who at one time was under private therapy treatment for an obsessivecompulsive disorder which explains his wearing of gloves indoors and outdoors eating at restaurants only with plastic utensils and his not stepping on the cracks of a sidewalk i do the same thing and no one diagnosed me with that pychological problem but come to think of it with me its more of a thing about it being bad luck to step on a crack <>
when i was taking college courses in psychology which is quite awhile ago i learned that this kind of disorder didnt have to lead to such illmannered behavior as melvin displays <>
which is why melvins character is more probably a combination of such obsessivecompulsive behavior and a case of rude manners <>
in other words he is a turd <>
{} well nicholson was real funny doing this compulsive schtick that borders on his just being a turd most of the time but at his edgiest moments when he crosses the line of common decency and reaches a point where the audience might not like him anymore he brought the most laughter to the screen <>
but you could just bet your honesttogod paycheck that when he threw that little dog of his gay next door neighbor the artist simon greg down his greenwich village apartment garbage chute in the opening scene his character was going to be redeemed by the end of the film <>
{} this feel good sitcom looking film goes on and on for a sometimes hilarious but too often obnoxious two hour and more as if this was an important film with so much to say that it couldnt leave out a scene or two or three as it manipulated some twists and turns into the story line and managed to show melvin at his bigoted worst and then at his most generous best <>
if you believe such readily made reversals then you are a better man than me gunga din <>
with simon he would go into his fag joke routine and with the only waitress carol hunt who would serve him in his favorite restaurant where he was a long time diner but where he was nevertheless disliked by everyone there including the owner he would poke personal insults at her <>
that is pretty much the story line <>
{} if you believe melvin has changed or if anything is supposed to happen that is for the better in his character then i guess you believe something i didnt or couldnt or rather i didnt care if i believed it or not since i sauced it out real pronto within the first five minutes of this flick that the story didnt matter much this was a cosmetic psychological rendering to a situation that could be real but that this film was not about real internal changes but about creating a slickness about its characterizations of people so the audience could have enough laughs at melvins insensitivity to others and be diverted by that and walk out of the theater happy to believe that melvin wasnt so bad a guy after all <>
{} what saves this film from itself is that because the actors are so good this film is actually a hoot in many different ways besides its great oneliners <>
the actors are really into their roles getting down pat the minutia of their characters <>
carol the single parent living with her mother in brooklyn wears house dresses middleaged apartment dwellers there might appreciate as she walks like she came out of the hospital which in fact is what she does mostly in the film a captive of her sons poorly treated asthma attacks <>
melvin walks like hes a bit daffy <>
i loved that slide step he had something like jackie gleason did on the honeymooners tv show <>
his outfits were a bland middleaged mans delight <>
hed fit in on any cruise liner <>
simon walks like hes the sensitive homosexual artist he is supposed to be <>
cuba gooding jr plays frank the gay art dealer and friend of simon <>
he walks as if he is wearing high heels to a grenwich village halloween party <>
{} after a few scenes of introducing melvin as a turd the film changes direction when simon is severely beaten up by robbers and he is forced to come down from his high horse of being so proud of who he thinks he is and gets melvin to watch the dog he recovered after melvin threw it down the chute <>
the film now proudly states look at how melvin has improved since he has fallen in love with mans best friend a dog <>
by walking the dog around town and bringing it to the restaurant he begins to make carol think that he is almost human <>
when carol quits her job to be nearer her sick son the distraught melvin cant get along without her serving him in the restaurant so he does the unthinkable without informing carol he pays for a topnotch doctor for her son who is able to cure the kid and make carol eternally grateful to him but she goes out of her way to make it clear to him that she never intends to sleep with him even though he has never even hinted at that <>
{} the remainder of the film is predictable and pretty much made up of contrived sitcom stuff <>
the only purpose of following the story from here on in is to get to hear some of the oneliners that breakup the tedium of the plot as melvin is in love with carol and has a chance of scoring even though she told him never <>
so what does the schlimazel do he screws it up by saying the worst thing he can possibly say to her <>
he even refuses to dance with her which i found to be a truly funny moment in the film <>
but the film couldnt take a chance of sticking to this unsafe type of humor and went back to its safer plot <>
and the plot keys in on how melvin is reforming for carol as it goes back and forth good melvin bad melvin unsure of how rotten or nice a guy they want to make melvin out to be by the films end <>
i wonder how many screening polls they must have had before they came up with the right box office formula for success <>
{} in any case some of my favorite lines in this flick were simon to melvin the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself carol to melvin come in and try not to ruin everything by being you <>
{} how good it couldnt be at least has a lot of funny moments to show for its efforts <>
i must say i thought helen hunt looked a lot like meryl streep <>
now thats a compliment helen <>

{} a heavy going and at times annoying but nevertheless embroiling drama <>
minnie plays a jewess in s london whose father is murdered and leaves the family impoverished <>
she refuses to marry a rich man chosen by her mother instead she seeks employment and takes a job on the isle of skye scotland in order to support her family <>
she hides her jewish identity because a christian is requested by the household <>
religion acts as an inhibiting and possessive experience throughout the film as the first time director weaves a tale of alienation and sexual liberation in a puritan type of setting <>
{} the film opens powerfully as the jewish ritual in the temple is shot in chiarasco <>
it is easy to realize how difficult it is to break from ones religious traditions if you are raised and indoctrinated with it <>
minnie has left her world of cities and jewishness for a hostile gentile world she cannot fathom <>
the starkness and loneliness of this rural area leaves her agonized and deracinated <>
she subsequently finds romance with the master of the house the intellectually gifted wilkinson searching for a method to make the photographic image permanent who is a bit of a prude and a bigot though not as much as his bored wife walter is who idly chatters about escaping her lonely world for one of culture <>
in this perplexing type of atmosphere minnie is struggling to find who she is constantly put off by the foreign protestant countryside and the restictive family she is isolated with <>
{} the flaws in the film are that the direction is at times unfocused as too many scenes are awkwardly shot and difficult to watch and comprehend <>
there just seems to be too much internally going on for any followup scenes to uncover all the loose ends that remain untied <>
the protestant family is way too complicated to gloss over its th century life style <>
the film is too long and boring at times and the love affair was not credible considering the lack of passion these lovers were just not a believable match and the film hammers out too many far reaching religious themes that it cannot properly address <>
{} but the acting and cinemaphotography are superb <>
everyone performs with stagelike perfection <>
minnie was alluring in her role as a governess <>
it makes sense that her romance does not work that her lies are uncovered and that she returns to her jewish roots vulnerable and ready to find herself again <>
i especially was intrigued by her botanical walk scenes with the repugnant young girl she tutors florence as she forms a genuinely warm relationship with her despite the childs obvious faults <>
her sexually explicit scenes with wilkinson added to the religious tremors of the film and the sense of her alienation but since i did not find their passion convincing it was difficult for me to believe that their relationship would have taken place <>
{} the governess is an absorbing marvelously acted film but not necessarily an entertaining one <>

{} some might find this appealing film about parisian twentysomethings who refuse to grow up to be quite amusing <>
these troubled studentintellectual types love to talk and are charmingly neurotic in a film that unjustifiably goes on for three hours but does so in a surprisingly breezy fashion <>
i would have more carefully edited this film as there were too many scenes that were nice but not impactful enough to keep <>
what the film does just right that caught my interest from a psychological point of view is penetrate the students loneliness the mindgames they play their ideas about sex and love their foolish need to lie and the tribal nature of their relationships <>
{} the antihero of the film is the slightly built paul dedalus mathieu almaric who plays a natural charmer and vulnerable lover to the three girls esther sylvia and valie <>
they charmingly fall in love with him and are the cause of all his mental angst <>
at times he seems to be merely exhibiting a case of childish pouting unprepared to find out what he wants to do in life <>
these sort of devilish characters could be very attractive to the opposite sex especially if they are handsome like he is and equipped with a facade of sensitivity and innate intelligence <>
{} paul is a yearold assistant professor unhappy in his underpaid college position as a philosophy teacher yet unable to finish his doctorate failing to take his exams which prevents him from becoming part of the permanent staff <>
he continues to be indecisive about what to do about his career and personal life <>
for the last years he has been with his goodnatured girlfriend esther devos whom he wants to dump even though he loves her and she is perfect for him but he strangely thinks that she is holding him back <>
so he picks a fight with her <>
you see he thinks he loves another girl even more sylvia denicourt whose performance steals the film because of her unwitting sexual charm being displayed in such a capricious manner <>
our hero has broken up with her after a brief fling twoyears ago but she happens to be going out now with his best and only friend nathan salinger <>
nathan does not know that he knew sylvia before which should tell you something about their close friendship <>
this really fine ensemble cast takes this meandering reallife type of a story and makes it into an absorbing drama carefully scrutinizing their intricate and confusing lives <>
{} paul finally dumps esther after he meets a girl named valie jeanne balibar at a party given by an acquaintance jeanjacques denis <>
valie is very demanding and suffers from being a bit metally unbalanced <>
jeanne balibar gives an eyecatching performance one that adds just the right degree of spice to the meal being cooked <>
he also wants to be with the evasive patricia chiara mastroianni the naive girlfriend of the last two months of his cousin and roommate bob thibault de montalembert <>
bob like paul has a confused concept about relationships lightheartedly boasting about all his conquests <>
{} the friends always seem to be together which brings about some sexual tension <>
they pseudo intellectualize about their relationships and prowl around the university hangouts of the incrowd and have a facility to behave in an irresponsible manner not unlike many students the world over do <>
paul adds his own perspective to what is happening as he offers some colorful voiceovers explaining the confused situation he is in and reads the minds of the others he is involved with offering his unique take on their problems <>
{} there are a few diverting subplots that are deftly handled by the director as paul is snubbed by his pretentious exfriend rabier vuillermoz who becomes to his chagrin head of the epistemology department at the university <>
these embarrassing snubs emphasize to paul how he is really unsatisfied with how his life is going and this forces him to make another foolish decision he decides to leave the university because his pride had been hurt <>
paul goes to his university mentor for guidance professor chernov roland who turns out to be absentminded and unable to offer sound advice to the reluctant scholar <>
{} what the film fails to do after one may grow weary of all the charm it exudes is provide any rationalizations or explanations for the splitups and ongoing relationships <>
by the time the film ends we are just as much in the dark as we were in the beginning of the film about his love life except we now know who is doing what to the other <>
there are no shared intimacies or greater emotional or intellectual depths explored <>
but the film is still a rather compelling and superbly actedout black comedy that has its glorious moments but cannot go past its own facile limits it setfor itself <>
but any film that can intelligently engage the philosophers kundera and kierkegaard into its story and have an arrogant professor lose his pet monkey in the radiator of his dorm apartment has my vote of approval <>

{} to make artistic films in a repressed country is very difficult but to make documentaries for an amateur filmmaker can work simply because he is an amateur and is not expected to be after something politically dangerous therefore he is thought of as less of a risk to those governments <>
{} this film is about how a factory worker philip mosz stuhr who bought himself a cheap handheld mm russian camera costing him two months salary for the birth of his daughter to record her birth and infant years <>
his boss stefan czyzewski spotted the camera and asked him to make a movie about the factory <>
from that humble beginning as soon as philip felt the things he could do with the camera he knew that this would be his vocation <>
he thought he could make a difference in society by pointing out how things really are exposing any corruption and giving people a record of how they are living <>
{} kieslowski went from making documentaries to making this fictional film and in some ways this film is semiautobiographical as it is about what power there is in the camera especially for one who is an artist <>
{} philip is the central focus of the film as he undergoes a transformation of personality <>
we first see him as a picture of contentment he is satisfied with his job as a procurer travelling around poland buying products for his factory and we see him satisfied with his marriagehe even mentions if someone wants only one thing in life hell get it and he shares with his wife what they both wanted a simple and quiet existence <>
{} when he shows the completed film to his boss about factory life it is met with approval except for four minor changes the boss insists upon <>
the naive new filmmaker has no qualms about getting rid of the pigeons but he doesnt understand why he cant leave in the film the men coming out of the lavatory or the men taking money behind a curtain or showing the little man with glasses in many of the scenes <>
{} after winning third prize for the film in a contest sponsored by the film club the movie bug has really bitten him <>
he has joined the film club where he gets romantically interested in one of the club leaders ana ewa who makes it her personal business to see that he gets help in his new film career <>
his wife becomes displeased with him for spending so much time away from the family and threatens to walk out on him which she will shortly do <>
but philip cant stop filming anything that moves as his techniques and artistic plans grow <>
to get help the club introduces him to krzysztof zanussi for advice and to have the famous director talk to his film club and they also get him a meeting with andrzej jurga who tells him to make a film about a worker and hell see that it gets on tv <>
this turns out to be a bittersweet trap for philip because he gets his work on tv and it is met with success by his friends and neighbors who watched it but his boss is displeased that it is about a cripple in the factory and does not blame philip for doing it because he is young but blames his superior the elderly and kindhearted osuch nowak whom he forces to resign his post as head of culture and coerces him into early retirement <>
it seems that even though he didnt intend to he hurts those who are not responsible for what he does <>
{} this is a political spoof on the artists role and limits in communist poland and a comedy as it comically exaggerates the film buffs growing pathology and voyeuristic tendencies <>
the power in the story was in the subtle reminders showing that behind the obvious censorship there is a real censorship problem for everyone it is not only in the conflicts between the artist and the authorities but for both the artist and the viewer who must demand that the truth and integrity of the work be preserved <>
poland is a good example of such a battlefield with the then stateowned film industry in charge of funding projects documentary films are sometimes the best records of such history unless you have the artistic deftness like kieslowski has shown to make a film as wickedly ironical as this one is and get it past the censors <>
{} since the films theme has been done many times before and the comic efforts of the film were rather flat what made this film provocative was the absorbing performance by jerzy stuhr who would become a regular in many of the directors later films which spanned a career of over years <>
stuhr was able to make this political tale into a human interest story something that deceptively caught the artists struggle highlighting the conflict over his compulsion to film and his personal sacrifice of losing his family <>
{} for the filmmaker as kieslowski sees it homelife is secondary <>
and for showing that struggle through stuhrs eyes the film is memorable though it is not one of the directors topflight artistic works yet it is still worth seeing <>

{} satyajit rays th and last film he died in is one that he shot in radiant color and is as close as you can come to being a masterpiece and not be one it is much better than some of his recent films which seemed to show his oldfashioned humanistic ideas of what a film should be like to be in a decline with the modern theater goers taste <>
this film moved me a great deal as i found empathy with his deep feelings about the observations he has made regarding the affects of civilization <>
{} in his swan song it is very much apparent that the great film director has made this work very much autobiographical speaking through the hermit visitor of a niece he has not seen in years seeing her last when she was only yearsold as he returns to calcutta his place of birth as an old man who is wizened for having traveled the world and for having lived among savages for most of his life <>
{} the plot is rather plain <>
the greatuncle mitra dutt played with a certain grain of boldness and great wit and a fierce sense of humor and a proper restraint writes in impeccable bengali to his wealthy niece anila mamata that he will visit her for one week and realizes the visit might come as a surprise to her but wants to know if she can accept him and offer him the hospitality of a traditional indian family visit <>
this causes concern for her husband sudhindra depankar de who is a successful and welleducated executive as they fear he might be an imposter after their money but yet they feel obligated to honor their traditional roles in life <>
only their yearold son satyaki bikram seems to be genuinely glad of the visit and easily accepts him as his uncle intrigued by his knowledge and generosity of spirit <>
{} when asked why he left his family and had no contact with them for all these years he animatedly tells them it was wanderlust and the bisons he saw painted on the caves by the savages before the age of civilization this encouraged him to become an anthropologist and not a painter and live among the different tribal people of the world he feels that no painter could learn the art better than the savages have <>
this makes sudhindra more suspicious of him than before as he thinks that he is certainly scholarly and articulate and welltravelled but he might be this clever because he is really an impostor <>
so he devices several ways to trap the uncle into telling the truth one by having the visitor show him his passport which he readily does and secondly by having his trial savvy lawyer friend prithwish dhritiman crossexamine him <>
the family has no other way of confirming in a hurry if this is really their uncle <>
{} the confrontation between prithwish who is a defender of rationalism and science but is primarily looking out for his friends interest in finding out who this visitor really is as he does his best to bring out the uncles beliefs in the virtues and superiority of the primitive culture agreeing with him only that religion sets up barriers between people and causes more harm than it does good <>
but prithwish is worn down after an evening of sharp conversations and badly deflated that his arguments dont hold up that well and embarrasses the family by leaving angrily and telling the uncle that he should either prove who he is or leave <>
while the uncle only seems more anxious after this exhausting talk to clear up some business he has to take care of and to get back to his tribal people where he feels more comfortable than with the bourgeoisie <>
{} rays choice of traditional music and primitive folk dance numbers especially when the uncle sees his niece dance with the women members of the santhal tribe is pulsating to behold and a reminder to us that we shouldnt forget our roots <>
the opulence and warmhearted nature of the film overcame the lack of real suspense the film had and its predictability <>
his light touch and simple human gestures with the camera poured out a delightfully intellectual array of food for thought allowing this film to be both visually entertaining and a homage to a great directors creative life questioning and stirring up his audience to keep knowing more about themselves and the world they live in as he leaves us with this last eloquent film one that has his signature firmly on it <>

he has lost his childlike innocence already being a petty crook and a breaker of the law but is still sexually innocent <>
he is living with and helping out his singleparent father by doing the dirty work his father is counting on him to do that keeps his unsavory business going <>
his father who insists igor call him by his christian name roger gourmet has a construction business where he employs illegal immigrants and exploits and traffics in them <>
they come from all over the world but mostly from bosnia and africa <>
his love for his son is so twisted and wrongly placed even if it is some form of love that he offers that it still results in his son being raised by a monster keeping him out of school at a distance from his regular teen friends allowing him to smoke cigarettes freely even tattooing him with the same tattoo he has and the worst thing he does is corrupt him with a false set of values while having the audacity to tell him that he is doing all these illicit things for his sake <>
{} on the day that the government inspectors appear at the work site the illegals are told to hide from the inspectors <>
one of the illegals amidou rasmane from burkina faso falls from a scaffold and needs to be rushed to the hospital <>
igor drags him out of the inspectors sight but not before amidou makes him promise that if he dies he will look after his wife and baby <>
when roger finishes showing the inspectors around and discovers amidou is severely injured he refuses to take him to the hospital afraid that he doesnt know what to tell the hospital has happened without arousing their suspicions <>
instead he does the most savage thing he could possibly do he gets igor who is becoming very squeamish at this point to help him bury amidou in concrete even if he is aware that amidou is still barely alive <>
{} how cruel can people be to others <>
as for roger there was no question about it his generosity did not include those outside of his small circle and immigrants and especially black ones were barely even human to him <>
but something has happened to the kid <>
he has developed a sense of guilt knowing fullwell he has done something wrong and he also knows that he is trapped he has to make a decision one way or the other either be with his father or help the widow <>
whichever way he goes there will be a price to pay for him he will not be able to satisfy both parties <>
going with his father is morally wrong but perhaps easier for him and a more understandable choice considering that his other choice is with a people he knows nothing about <>
but the other choice he understands is the right one and he wrestles with his conscience as he tries to help the widow without hurting his father <>
{} la promesse has the harsh reality to it that a documentary might have and considering that the sibling film directors are acclaimed documentary directors for over two decades it is easy to see that even though this story is fictionalized it neverthess is filmed in the manner of the very real experiences that the filmmakers have noted going on in modern europe <>
the illegals on the bottom end of the totem pole with no legal right granted them to be where they are are at the mercy of such heartless and bigoted people as these who swoon down upon them as vultures <>
{} the three main characters of the story are cast perfectly <>
igor indicates by his facial expressions that he wants to be a kid again but cant as he learns how to face up to the different situations that keep popping up in his life <>
when we first meet him he is seen as a slick liar and petty thief swiping a womans wallet and then we see him as he gradually changes and develops an empathy for the widow of the immigrant maybe even thinking of her as the mother he doesnt have but certainly needs <>
he watches with a warm scrutiny as she fiercely tries to protect her child from all the outside evils <>
{} the film could have been done from the fathers point of view instead of the sons and even more interestingly from assitas the widow way of seeing things and the film would have still had a tremendous impact <>
she has a regality about her that is peerless even when she is searching for the truth about her husbands disappearance not satisfied with the stories roger and igor are telling her <>
when she is left stranded under a trestle and two belgians piss on her as they are perched above her we see in her anger and frustration that she is lost in a country of white people she does not understand <>
but there is an unmistakable presence she has that clearly shows the nobility of her character especially when contrasted with all those around her whose minds are so blemished <>
{} roger is one of the slimiest guys you could ever meet someone who tries to pretend he is good but it so obviously not that it is written all over him what he really is <>
but the character he has is fitting for the person he is <>
there is room for us to see in him what makes him act the way he does that he is not that far removed from the consciousness of the ordinary man in the street except for his utter lack of decorum and any sort of social conscience <>
from his point of view we could see that he is only looking out for number one thinking that if he doesnt who else will <>
an argument you will frequently hear from the man in the street as he tries to rationalize his vices <>
{} to further contrast the differing white and black cultures we see how the western medical profession treatment of her differs from the one she intuitively trusts as she goes to a witch doctor <>
igors guiltridden help results in assita being taken to a hospital to find out why her baby is so sick <>
but they cant see anything wrong <>
so she consults an african spiritualist <>
he determines that she can save the baby by going to see relatives in italy that there is nothing that she can accomplish here the baby is telling her to leave <>
{} when the young igor cant live with his fathers cruel dishonesty anymore one of the more powerful confrontational scenes imaginable takes place between a father and son as the son removes the mental shackles he has worn all his life and places real chains on his father <>
he walks out on him choosing to help assita get out of the country rather than remain with his father <>
in a strange way without him or her being conscious of it she became his surrogate mother <>
{} this powerful tale is unflinchingly honest and moving <>
it casts a dark shadow over a civilized countrys technological prowess in the world and questions its humanity and moral perspectives <>
it does so in a most tangible way in a way that should be a disturbing reminder of how complex the problem of immigration is in a film that is piercingly on target as a challenge for the european countrys to keep their promise to the immigrants and to see how corrupt their system is and how it doesnt really stop these powerless people from being exploited <>

colonel page byron is the onedimensional dullard in charge of the security system and when the equally dull martian dop suddenly appears at the control center and tells the colonel and the reporter present that because of a genetic flaw there is a hundred to one ratio of males to females in mars and that martians are on a mission to voluntarily bring back females for purposes of reproducing more females and they offer promises that everything will be done in a nonviolent manner with the cooperation of the girls and so the gauntlet is dropped <>
but the colonel refuses to abet the martians in this enterprise as dop disappears but not before mentioning that the mission will go on whether or not the u s cooperates <>
{} the martians thusly become the worlds first common enemy <>
they have landed in an abandoned chemical dump somewhere around one of texas main cities and have neutralized all radar systems and dishes used for detection <>
dop warns his other medical missionaries that they have hours to complete their mission so they will have to resort to using hypnosis on their subjects <>
they are told to not eat the earth food and to spread out borrowing suits from a closed clothing store and currency and city maps from a filling station and cars from the airport parking lot picking that spot because the cars shouldnt be missed in the shortrun and will be returned when they depart <>
the martians observe that ties are worn here something they discarded in mars years ago as something useless <>
thats about as deep a jab at political satire this film takes <>
{} the five women chosen as perfect female specimens by the superpolite abductors are all good lookers who range from being a stripteaser an airline stewardess a college homecoming queen an artist and dr bolen <>
the longest and most drawn out abduction is with dop romancing an alltoowilling dr bolen and we get to watch the two fall in love while they visit the planetarium <>
it was delightful to see them hold hands and in the end have him decide whether his love for her will cause him to disobey his mission as he must decide whether to return to mars or jump ship <>
love is something that has gone out of vogue in mars for the last years but our hero says this is what it must feel like <>
she never realized he was a martian which shows you that even experts on mars could be fooled <>
the suspense for the conclusion is breathtaking as the martians have to abort their mission with the u s army on their tails and there are genuine tears falling from dr bolen <>
{} arguably the films best scene is when the martians need a room in the texas hotel that is booked solid and they get the room and the occupants press credentials by hypnotizing the seattlesun reporter in it as he looks at the reflecting lights in the pool and thereby is convinced to go home <>
{} what goes for special effects are scenes where women are disappearing and aliens are appearing out of thin air <>
what goes for a martian wardrobe are scubadiving space suits and on their ears hockey pucks are worn from which a vertical footlong antenna protrudes <>
{} if you are in the mood for something to see that is inane a film that edward wood jr would be proud of but in the hands of an edgar ullmer could have been much more notable then this one could hit your funny bone <>
in any case i was in a silly mood when i saw it and was not disappointed it was as bad as i thought it would be and i thoroughly enjoyed it <>

{} firsttime film director and former music video director spike jonze has come up with a tantalizing feast for the self to nosh on cooked by charles kaufmans original screenplay that offers up some very intangible delicacies on its plate such as a psychological personal and sexual identity study allowing the eater to suspend belief about what is being digested and be allowed to tastefully enter into the mind of another being <>
it is a playful and provocative look at determining ones identity and how celebrity is viewed from within featuring an actual celebrity the performer john malkovich who is playing himself as the mind who is being entered <>
if someone could market via virtual reality how to actually do that it might cost as much as for a minute sightseeing trip down that path the charge established in the film for such a trip while for the movie viewer it is only for the nominal cost of a movie ticket that one gets to have such a unique experience <>
{} craig schwartz john cusack the films wormy unemployed new york puppeteer and unlikely protagonist appearing scraggy looking and acting despondent and unhappy with his lot in life as someone who knows his craft but is not appreciated by the public he wishes to conquer and therefore cant do the work he believes he was put on earth to do <>
the last straw for craig is seeing his successful competitor put up a gimmicky display overhanging a highway in weschester county of a gigantic foot emily dickinson entitled the belle of amherst <>
he rationalizes his failure to get noticed by stating nobodys looking for a puppeteer in todays wintry economic climate <>
{} at home he is lost in his own problems with his schlumplike pet store employed wife lotte cameron diaz who is a pet enthusiast having an assortment of pets in the house including a chimpanzee whom she loves more than her husband <>
the husband is the one who cheerfully is being nagged by her to get a job until something materializes for him as a puppeteer <>
so he scans the newspapers and our hero seeks out a job as a filing clerk for the lester corporation absurdly located on the th floor in a manhattan skyscraper that has low ceilings forcing everyone to stoop when walking <>
the running gag being that the overhead and the rent are also low here <>
{} employed on the same floor as our hero is an attractive fasttalking sarcastic bundle of promising sex maxine lund keeler who has our hero tonguetied and in a flirtatious mood who is not rebuffed by her dislike of his physical appearance <>
she is perfect for the part of the films bitch <>
{} what also excites him about his new job is that he discovers a portal behind his filing cabinet that goes tunnellike down into the mind of john malkovich and after minutes throws him out on the grassy side of the new jersey turnpike <>
since the glimpse into malkovichs head is more or less fictional its delightfully funny to find craig turning up inside the mans head and to find the actor eating toast and reading the wall street journal in his park avenue apartment <>
{} a business partnership between the scheming maxine and craig is consumated as the two decide to advertise in the newspaper and take celebrity seeking visitors into the secret portal allthrough the night <>
when lotte finds out about the portal she is exhilarated by the experience of being inside the actors head and watching him on a date with maxine <>
lotte becomes the second member of the schwartz family to fall headoverheels for the irresistible maxine <>
it seems when inside the head of the actor the schwartzs are able to attract the elusive maxine but when left to their own identities she treats them as nobodies <>
{} having their fun with this nutty script is orson bean as the yearold entrepreneur dr lester who is the head of the lester corporation and is devilishly amusing as the lecherous businessman and the man who knows more about the portal than it appears he does as he uses it as a way of living forever by changing identities <>
also seen at work is floris mary kay place as a confused secretary who is an expert on speech impediments but who doesnt realize she suffers from one herself and gives an outstanding supporting performance adding more punch to an already zany story <>
{} the film was brilliant in spots but towards the end ran out of enough nourishing food to sustain its steady diet of farcical comedy <>
but even as it was petering out it still managed to have enough brilliant glimpses at celebrity and how some crave that sort of identity to make it both hilarious and somewhat intellectually appealing and leave off with an ending that is unnerving <>
what makes this insane premise work out so surprisingly well is that the actors get the joke and run with it even flushing out seemingly irrelevant things about ones inner being along the way that are fun to scrutinize <>
and if anything more can be said about john malkovich than that he is a grand actor it is that he comes across as a good person someone with a good sense of humor and someone who is able to heartily have a laugh at himself even if it is supposedly at his own expense <>
this is the kind of strange film that one would expect to be released as an arthouse indie yet here it is playing as a mainstream big production <>

{} daringly enough this leftist sympathizing political drama was made during the remaining days of the rightist colonels regime <>
it is one of those extra long minutes and slowly paced films that is a chore to stay tuned into <>
one deserves to get a c in audience for just remaining awake while watching it <>
it doesnt help that the characters are not appealing and do not draw us into their story <>
the thing here is history as mixed in with the loose telling of aeschylus oresteia tragedies characters are even named orestes electra and chrysothemis <>
its lesson in modern greek history goes from as a travelling actor troupe performs a single folk play golfo the shepherdess in different towns all over greece <>
we see them in towns that appear to be shabby and depressing as the years keep changing as does the political climate <>
the times are torn with nazis ww axis occupation civil war between the right and left wings british occupation and the impending election of marshal papagos representing a military monarchist regime <>
he is the one who defeated the leftwing during the civil war <>
things certainly look glum the only cheer comes from the actors as they are transported through the farout regions of greece and sing their rhythmic songs of freedom love and sadness with a dignity and verve that enraptures the film in a very moving mood <>
you can feel the pulse of the times through the music and realize that big events are happening to the people of greece <>
{} the film assumes a lot for a foreign audience viewing it that they would be knowledgable about greek political happenings and of the greek tragedies and of its history <>
the modern greek history of betrayal revenge and redemption are both the subtle and underlying themes of the story as seen through the eyes of the weary acting troupe <>
the film begins in in the town of aegion where the acting troupe visited last in <>
the actors get caught up in the political manifestations themselves as the film traces what happened to the troupe in the past the wife of the troupes leader takes a fascist lover and has a bastard child while the husband is a leftist and goes off to fight in the war <>
their son orestes is being buried in after he became a rebel soldier who died in prison <>
in the most moving scene of the film the actors bury him and start applauding him for the life he lived as he is buried it is as if they were saying what a performance you gave in life <>
{} most of the film was unfortunately not as stimulating and was too trying a task to follow in all its different kind of historical rejoinders even though this is a worthy film visually bringing real life into focus in a way that is unique and psychologically absorbing <>
there is no doubt about it this is a theo angelopoulos film not relying on cohesiveness of plot or dialogue to tell its story for the record of history <>
his camera moves around for many different and enticing angle shots but his takes go on forever touching every little gesture and staying with them for minutes at a time without any action taking place making the film a very difficult watch for most nongreeks <>
{} the highly stylized scene in a restaurantbar best caught the feelings of the two opposing sides in the civil war and of those who just tried to remain neutral <>
the leftist were unarmed seemed jovial and danced with their women while the rightist all wore their hats with the brim covering their eyes and danced with the men and fired their guns in the air <>
they were the menacing winners <>
the neutrals just tried to please those in charge at the time <>
{} theo angelopoulos is a great filmmaker but this first feature of his to achieve international recognition is not a great film as much as it is a vital telling about political intrigue <>
it is a film that is relevant a good peek at modern greece and how it is politically divided <>
it is a chance to see how overreaching and meddling the british and the americans are seen by the greek left <>
it is also the story of the communists failure to gain control of the country and the implications there are for a state that stays in power by suppressing its people <>
my hat is off to anyone who can say they were enthralled with this entire film not the pieces of it here and there like i was <>

[20864/a]
{} this is a dogma styled film where the danish filmmakers group manifesto determines the rules for how the film is to be made <>
the idea is to give their films a fresh look and for them to provide the unexpected and to catch on film the complete truth from its characters and their situations <>
this film was shot with a small video camera a sony pc that fits in the palm of your hand then it is transferred to the prescribed dogma millimeter format <>
i suppose it is fair to assume that one of the reasons that this manifesto was drawn up in by four danish filmmakerschristian levring soren kraghjacobsen thomas vinterberg and lars von trier was to give them publicity and challenge the film community to create innovative films <>
so far the only two films i saw from this group von triers the idiots breaking the waves have been challenging and impressive films <>
{} for those interested in what their dogma document actually states i give you the following example <>
shooting must be done on location <>
props and sets must not be brought in <>
if a particular prop is necessary for the story a location must be chosen where this prop is to be found <>
the sound must never be produced apart from the image or vice versa <>
music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being shot <>
the camera must be handheld <>
any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted <>
the film must not take place where the camera is standing shooting must take place where the film takes place <>
the film must be in color <>
special lighting is not acceptable <>
if there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a single lamp must be attached to the camera <>
optical work and filters are forbidden <>
the film must not contain superficial action <>
murders weapons etc must not occur <>
temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden <>
that is to say that the film takes place here and now <>
genre movies are not acceptable <>
the film format must be academy mm <>
the director must not be credited <>
furthermore i swear as a director to refrain from personal taste <>
i am no longer an artist <>
i swear to refrain from creating a work as i regard the instant as more important than the whole <>
my supreme goal is to force the truth out of my characters and settings <>
i swear to do so by all the means available and at the cost of any good taste and any aesthetic considerations <>
{} rules like that rub me the wrong way <>
what i ask from a film is for it to be imaginative and wellmade and i dont particularly care how the filmmaker accomplishes that <>
{} henning moritzen is helge played with a restraint and a certain brilliance not allowing himself to become a stereotypical villain <>
helge a prosperous patriarch is celebrating his sixtieth birthday by having his family and friends come to his countryestate hotel for his bourgeois birthday party complete with a hired toastmaster bondam to keep things looking wellorganized and professional <>
the celebration will turn into a feast of dark family secrets revealed bombshell style in front of all the guests and hotel staff while everyone tries to catch their breath and figure out how to act <>
{} it would be impossible to go into the minute details of the film without immeasurably spoiling it for the viewer who hasnt seen the film <>
my pleasure in seeing it was that i was caught completely unaware of what was to occur and that shock kept me absorbed in the story not quite knowing what to expect next <>
this might be the secret reason why the film worked so well as i was made to feel like one of the guests in this theatrical film <>
{} the psychically crippled children and their estranged relationship with their father is the key to the story <>
christian ulrich thomsen is the eldest son brooding that his twin sister linda has within the year taken her life in her bathtub <>
he missed her funeral which was the last family gathering and hasnt seen anyone in the family for quite a while living in paris even owning a few restaurants there <>
but christians mission for coming to this party has a definite purpose it is to let his father know what has been on his mind ever since childhood <>
he will be able to accomplish this mission with the help of the hotel staff who keep the guests from leaving by stealing their car keys and with the needed personal aid of the chef bjarne his childhood friend who will see to it that he gets a chance to get his message across <>
he will also get solace from the pretty waitress pia trine who is in love with this troubled soul <>
then there is the youngest in the family michael thomas bo larsen christians volatile brother whom the family is ashamed of because of his crudeness and instability who is married to a vulgar woman helle dolleris whom he treats like a dog <>
but at least he is the only one of the children to provide his father with three grandchildren <>
helene paprika steen is the flighty sister who studied anthropology and now wants to be a singer suffering from depression who brings an american black man gbatokai to the celebration which will culminate in the families racist feelings coming out in the open <>
all the children are disappointments to the incestuous father <>
their mother birthe acts as the fathers voice of reason in all the family matters trying to soothe out the wrinkles in their life by turning a blind eye to what she sees until even she cant look away any more <>
{} the result of the film was exhilerating dogma or not it is a work that is scathing penetrating layers of deceit and festering wounds that cannot be healed <>
the guests were left confused by all the startling revelations they were privy to some wanting to just leave but couldnt some trying to decide if what they were hearing was true or not but amazingly taking it all in stride as if they were shockproof <>
but the cruel truth and tenseness rule the weekend even when all the disturbances are deftly handled by the toastmaster who tried to keep the traditional birthday party afloat with good cheer and dance and games <>
but it was to no avail <>
{} to point out how the guests werent quite sure of anything that was happening there they are shown eating lobster or salmon or tomato soup each one unsure of what they were served <>
{} the celebration is indeed a celebration not to be forgotten soon <>
it drains the emotions somehow satisfies the intellect and challenges the conventions of the usual fare of sophisticated family drama <>
i felt like i was serving as a witness for this dysfunctional family asked to judge the family head as he is forced into finding out who he really is <>
vinterberg declares how the impact of helges revelation affected everyone in the immediate family and how that acted as a cleansing for the tribe something that was essential for their psyches <>
at least they now have some kind of a shot of pulling themselves together even though the film does not show any of them changing internally <>
they are still their old selves good and bad after the revelations come out but only this time they are all on the right side and are more armed with information about what went on as they were growing up <>
and how the film accomplished this was through good storytelling where one doesnt need any false constraints something that is reminiscent of greek tragedy or shakespearean drama <>

{} without john hurts magnificent performance he appears in every scene and is very apealing this film would have fallen flat on its face <>
he plays a reclusive stuffy londonite scholarly writer in scorn of modern society living in an immaculate librarylike house that has none of the modern everyday technology most people take for granted in america and great britain such as a tv vcr microwave computer and so on <>
he is stubbornly set in his ways <>
and as we are introduced to him we find him to be a bit arrogant as well as someone who is out of touch with reality <>
{} he goes by the name of giles death which fits the prudish image this recent widower conveys his name also comes awfully close to being pronounced as death is <>
oddly enough he never goes to the cinema i could not even imagine anyone living without going to the cinema <>
but his life changes drastically after he gives a bbc interview and begins to open up a bit and after talking with a colleague he daringly goes to see a film based on an e m forster novel that is playing in a multiplex theater <>
since he has no clue about how these theaters operate he mistakenly ends up seeing something called hotpants college lo and behold he at first thinks he is watching the forster movie and is disgusted with it but as he is about to exit he suddenly falls in love with one of the male stars of this soft core porn film an aspiring actor ronnie bostock engagingly played by jason priestley <>
this changes his life as he decides to become the foremost expert on bostocks life researching all the films and magazine interviews he has done <>
it is like he becomes a teenager again hiding the filthy magazines from his housekeeper and somehow managing to buy a vcr to watch these films <>
it is amusing to see that when he gets home he doesnt realize that he has to have a tv to see the videos <>
{} but this is not enough of a challenge for him so he decides to fly to long island where bostock lives with his girlfriend the glamorous model audrey fiona <>
he uses his charm to get to meet her and will soon meet bostock when he returns from l a <>
we get a tour of long island ugh <>
and we watch how giles changes seemingly becoming a more gentle and sensitive person but his love is not returned by bostock in the physical way he wishes it returned who handles himself with dignity over giless mistaken advances <>
what remains interesting to ponder further is the relationship between the two males <>
it is the old opposites attract syndrome in this case it is trashy pop star meets a scholar from a former century and only the scholar falls madly in love as the trashy pop star is only interested in the class and knowledge that the scholar exudes <>
{} the comic effects of the film seem light enough that is until the homoerotic pulsations become overbearing and we are left in the end with a rather awkward drama being played out that is somehat unnerving to behold made plausible only by hurts presence as a commanding performer <>
yet it is tastefully done but not as biting as thomas manns film version of the same theme death in venice <>
the message of love and death on long island could fit either pop or aesthetic culture coming to the conclusion that love is strange <>
i believe mickey and sylvia had a s hit song about that theme <>

{} racial hatred is something that we are not born with <>
it is a learned response <>
american history x examines how two los angeles brothers learn how to hate from their families their communities their schools their friends and from a country that doesnt fulfill everyones expectations of it <>
films of this nature are very difficult to do firstly because they tend to become merely message vehicles and secondly hatred is a mindset that must be unlearned and films tend to think that they must sermonize to get their good intentions across and sermons as a rule do not make for pleasing dramatics <>
when this film is most effective it goes for the jugular of its racist veins and pulls back no punches using lucid arguments about why there is racial disharmony in this country and it does so in the language used on the street <>
when it backtracks and feels that it has to explain itself and sort of apologize for what it has shown and allows the main character off the racial hook rather abruptly the story seems to weaken and become somewhat artificial like so many other films of this ilk afraid to let completely go and allow the chips to fly where they may <>
what the producers of the film might be afraid of is that the message about why youngsters become racists was too convincingly done that their gripes are too reasonable and might leave a bitter taste in the mouths of those who cant face the realities of life in contemporary america <>
that this is a country where so many of the nasty newspaper headlines seem to be about racial problems and also this is a country that is consumed by its bad karma from its past racial history to its unsettling now and it is thereby impossible to hide from these problems wherever one lives in this country <>
but to live in an american city that has changed from being an allwhite oneto one with many blacks seems to only exasperate the racial problems <>
this film convincingly exploits this racial tension up to a point as it tantalizes the audience with a reality that is lived out for real in many of the viewers everyday lives as many of them are the innocent ones caught in the crossfire of those extreme racists on both sides of the color line <>
{} so one of the questions that crosses my mind is what can this film add to our knowledge of hatred that would make us feel we are onto some way of dealing with it any better than we have until now <>
perhaps it is an unfair or an unanswerable question and not the purpose of any film to do but after seeing so much ugliness on screen using gang violence race baiting attitudes and the polarization of the races to make its point about the current social crisis it makes one wonder what is the method to unlearning the hatred learned especially when all the great religious leaders and artists and philosophers could only reach those who were convinced already that hatred was wrong and couldnt change the world into an harmonious place even if their message was an eloquent and a correct one <>
i expect this film will actually be relished for its provocative stance and its real sense of hatred it was able to duplicate in those white or black punks committing the violence with the extreme views of hatred outweighing any other message the film was trying to deliver <>
and that is the beauty of the film the real lesson it puts on the table the one that must be confronted it is what makes this film invaluable and genuine a documentarystyle look at racism <>
{} in britisher tony kayes debut feature after a successful career in doing tv commercials he brings some of the attention getting scenes that commercials use to reach the consumer and has come up with a riveting film that paints a necessary ugly racial picture in bold blackandwhite photography during some of its more graphically violent scenes <>
but the director was not satisfied with the finished product claiming that the films star edward norton reedited the final version giving himself more screentime and that the studio themselves changed the film so that it could be more acceptable to a greater audience <>
the film did have an incomplete look to it and its ending did seem to be missing something as there appeared to be holes in the story and the film ended too abruptly to make sense <>
nevertheless the director did a good job this is a provocative film and it is one that is grounded in reality and will be remembered for its powerful images of hatred <>
{} how do people feel when they see such changes for the worst in their neighborhood and lump all people into stereotypes is answered by derek vinyard edward norton he joins a skinhead neonazi group after the last straw of his rationality is broken when his firefighter father russ is senselessly killed by a sniper in a black neighborhood while putting out a fire in a crack house <>
we will learn later on through one of the many flashbacks used that his father taught the kid to have these racists views as we listen to them converse over dinner <>
{} the story takes place in venice beach and derek tells us that blacks and hispanics have moved here recently from the ghettoes of l a and have changed the fabric of the once peaceful community by scaring the white kids in school bringing drugs and gangs into the area and taking over the basketball courts there was a basketball game between the skinheads and the black gang members over who will control the court that seemed too facile to be that convincing <>
{} american history x follows the life of the articulate rabblerouser derek and his impressionable younger brother danny edward furlong as they try to find their real identities in life <>
for the past year after his fathers death derek has become a fanatical member of a neonazi gang which is influenced by a devious adult cameron alexander keach who keeps in the background as he manipulates the boys with his sinister hatred and gets the willing derek to recruit and organize other disenfranchised whites into the gang <>
derek has many nazitype of tattoos on his body but the one that stands out like an emblazoned emblem of holy sanctimony is the giant swastika over his heart <>
{} his mother dangelo is dating a liberalminded jewish teacher from the local high school murray gould and has invited him over for dinner and the family is discussing the rodney king case with the contrasting views argued by derek in a passionate manner as he is defending the white cops while in a low key manner by murray who is appalled at the police brutality shown against the black man <>
the rational part of their argument comes to an end as dereks antisemitism is raised to a feverish pitch at the sight of murray sitting at the family table and going out with his mother and this causes a verbal barrage of hatred by him directed at the befuddled school teacher who is forced to leave the house and end the budding relationship with dereks mother <>
{} that night while derek is having sex with his neonazi girlfriend stacey balk danny spots a black youth breaking into their van and alerts his brother <>
derek comes out with his automatic weapon and kills two of them with the third escaping <>
but the cops come to the scene and arrest him in front of his house in the most powerful scene of the film he is standing in his underwear topless with his swastika standing out in the nighttime sky as he feels so proud of what he has done that he raises his eyebrows and gives off with an obscene smirk like the good neonazi he has become under camerons tutelage <>
for this act he receives three years in jail and his life will drastically change as he learns the errors of his ways the hard way reminescent of the old familiar western story of the gunman giving up his guns and returning to town as a peacemaker <>
{} in jail prisoners cling together by race <>
being white in prison means you are in the minority and as one of the black inmates lamont torry who reluctantly befriends the angry derek on a laundry work detail they share as he tells him in here you are the nigger <>
{} in order to be protected from the blacks who are out to get him derek stays with the white power faction <>
but when the white leader rapes him in the shower he disses the group by refusing to sit with them at the dining room <>
he was also disillusioned that his group didnt believe as seriously as he did in the message about white power and made political deals with the blacks and hispanics <>
his protection is now over and he is seen as a disheartened outcast <>
to his surprise lamont puts out the word among the blacks to leave him alone and because of this dereks racial feelings change and he can now look at blacks as being human again and so he decides that he cant go back to his neonazi gang again <>
this was the hardest part of the film to swallow whole especially when the change comes about so rapidly and the film did not do a good enough job storywise of showing how this change could be internally possible <>
what excelled though was the acting especially by norton who understood his role and got the most out of it <>
{} meanwhile back at school danny has murray as his history teacher and for homework writes a paper on mein kampf as an example of a great work on civil rights which upsets the teacher <>
the principal of the school a black man dr sweeney has two doctorates he is depicted as being twice as good as anyone in this film and will be the bridge of sanity for the film working to help his students beyond the call of duty <>
he was dereks teacher and enjoyed having the bright student in class and had visited him in jail vouching for his early release from prison on the condition he stops danny from making the same mistakes he did <>
what he decides to do for danny is to remove him from his history class and take a new subject with him called american history x <>
as his first assignment he is to write a report about what led his brother to prison and hand it in to him tomorrow <>
this hour period will prove itself to be eventful because derek gets released from prison and confronts the skinheads telling them that he no longer will be in their organization <>
this part of the story was too incredulous and sketchy for it to be anything but a wellintentioned but misguided effort at making everything turn out to be pat <>
dr sweeney was also too sketchy a characterization for the film to feel fluid <>
he seemed to be placed there to provide the film with a safe way out of its difficult dilemma it dug for itself regarding the extremity of race relations <>
but it was just that extremity and its rawness that gave the film the kind of edge to it that made it potent <>
{} danny has been under camerons influence while derek did his time <>
he is also being befriended by an overweight loser and fanatical neonazi seth suplee <>
the only character in the story that has the right energy to counter the neonazi influence on her heroworshipping brother is his sister davina jennifer lien <>
she is solid <>
her anger and impatience with the nonsense she is hearing is right on target <>
in her small part its too bad she wasnt given more to say she outshines the arguments against hatred presented by her weak mother the ineffective murray and the too good to be real principal <>
{} another horrible scene to look at is the flashback of the gang in action led by derek rampaging through a korean grocery store wrecking the place violating the black lady cashier and humiliating the koreans by putting different food all over their faces and beating them scenes like this are all done in black and white it is only when derek reforms his ways when out of prison that the film becomes ready to be in technicolor <>
{} the most obvious flaw of the film is that dereks ultra rightwing arguments against liberals and how the blacks are ruining the country never get answered back in a satisfactory way <>
there is no one to speak up for what most people in america think is fair <>
and so when the tragic ending to the film takes place what is there to say <>
we have seen the worst about america how herdlike certain people can behave and how the prison and the venice beach that is depicted both lump people into groups because of race <>
but if this is the current reality then there are certainly alternative realities where different human beings can live together in peace which the film tried to show through dr sweeneys presence but that didnt work because his actions seemed too contrived <>
{} it is too bad that derek couldnt see how rotten his ideas were in time maybe his intelligence wasnt all that it was cracked up to be <>
or maybe someone like cameron whom he will eventually call a chicken hawk because of his cowardly nature was too good at preying on the very vulnerable youngsters who need to belong to some hate group to express themselves and that his mother was too enfeebled to raise him properly and there was no one else around to reach him <>
he didnt seem like he was a criminal or the typical dumb skinhead type but he seemed as if he was someone who got confused over his bad ideas and didnt know what else to do <>
in my opinion the film didnt really capture the mindset of the neonazi wholly it just peeked in on them and was starting to zero in on their psyche and why they become skinheads and what makes them exit from being one but it ended up by just lumping them together with all the other sterotyped groups and failed to go far enough in showing us what makes them in particular tick <>
there just seemed to be too much ground this film was trying to cover and it just couldnt adequately cover the entire history of contemporary racism without turning the film into a documentary <>
{} but this is still a quality film that is both visually powerful and disturbing showing how much dirt there is to bring up about americas everpresent racial problems <>
i just wish the film didnt give us an entire years history curriculum about racism in two hours <>
if it didnt back off from its characterization of derek and danny and if it kept hitting the sore points in society that ordinary people find hard to talk about without getting overwrought or emotionally racial about we might have had a great film <>
the potential for this good film to be much better than it was was certainly there for the taking <>
and who can know for sure if tony kaye is right about what he says ruined his film <>
i guess all we can do is wait for his next film and see what he does with that one before we can fully accept his argument for what went wrong here but let me praise him and the fine supporting cast for what was right about the film which was most of the film <>

the relevance and devastating emotions of the slaves were intelligently presented even though at times the film was static and seemed to have no legs to get it going in the direction it wanted to be going <>
yet it still turned out to be a potent and forceful movie <>
{} it is hard to be critical of the stand for morality and piety the film makes but what saved this picture from being the holier than thou selfrighteous bomb i thought it might have been were the presence of john quincy adams hopkins and cinque in the film <>
hopkins gave life to the story by his stunning status and ability to articulate <>
cinque represented the black man whose viewpoint was seen through his massive physical strength and pride <>
he gave authenticity to the events of the story <>
without their human emotions one by his words the other by his facial expressions the film would not have been as impactful as it was <>
there could be only so much that one can take from watching the misery of others until it would become overbearing and defeat all its good intentions <>
{} the exploitation scenes of the slaves being captured by nets in their homeland and then chained on ships and some being thrown overboard to drown were truly malevolent acts and thankfully kept to a minimal portion of the films time <>
or else the film would have been a very difficult one to watch <>
{} for the trial of the slaves the abolitionists hire a selfpromoting realestate lawyer roger baldwin matthew to take their case <>
he at first does not realize the importance of the case he is taking on thinking all he has to do is treat it as an ordinary case of a property dispute <>
but he soon realizes that this is a very important case <>
he presents this question in court were they born as slaves on a plantation say in the west indies or as free men in africa <>
if it were the later he would win freedom for his clients because free men are allowed to resist being taken by force according to the constitution <>
he eventually gets cinque to speak through an interpreter and tell the story of his african mende tribal people who were captured by rival tribesman and sold to an illegal portuguese slave ship and eventually put aboard another ship la amistad in havana cuba <>
he also tells of the part he played in the revolt and taking over of the ship and then being tricked by the two surviving portuguese seamen into taking them to america instead of africa <>
{} spielberg is the master of a visual story and here he is in top form <>
the carnage and cruelty aboard the slave ship are shockingly and revealingly shot giving one enough of an idea what the slave had to endure <>
that gives the film the force and importance that is needed for it to make its moral point <>
the final moral point is made in front of the supreme court with john quincy adams saying if these men are not set free you might as well start the civil war now <>
he then proceeds to rip up a piece of paper to symbolize the death of the declaration of independence <>

{} how can a bad film be good <>
well in the hands of edgar g ulmer it is possible to end a film with an overbearing melodramatic paranoia to it on the edgy words of the protagonist who wonders to himself how fate could put the finger on you and me for no good reason at all and not be laughed at as pretentious dialogue <>
instead this work becomes a memorable cult film that can so easily in lesser hands than the skilled ulmer have fallen into the realm of inanity but here becomes a strong film about the meaning of fate <>
what is most amazing though is that this film was shot in six days in a poverty row studio on an extremely low budget without an attempt to get any location shots for a story that centers around a crosscountry hitchhiking trip and yet it remains gritty and realistic even if the film is full of technical errors <>
it remains fully a part of the rich history of bw noir films <>
it is also an example of what the big studios cant seem to do well how in their attempt to make a film that is pleasing to a large market share of the audience they too often lose track of how interesting a story can be without the usual formula applied to it or the need for making it glitzy and they fail to get into the soul of their stars where they should have been going in the first place <>
which might explain how this poorly acted weaklycrafted story was so much applauded by film buffs that it has reached classical cult status in film lore and is even revered by certain noted directors such as martin scorsese and was heldup by the french movie critics as a work of true art when they discovered the neglected film in <>
{} al roberts tom neal is a piano player in new york city who is in love with the singer sue claudia drake in the divelike club he plays at <>
but she is ambitious and breaks off their marriage telling him that she is going to los angeles to try to make it to the bigtime <>
despondent he phones her after she is there for quite awhile and learns that she is working as a waitress <>
he tells her that even if hes broke he will still hitch out there to be with her <>
{} the film opens with him hitching a ride to a reno diner telling people at the counter that he wants to go east <>
the story is told in flashback as the grousing hitchhiker hears the song i cant believe you fell in love with me played on the jukebox and we find out what happened to him to make him so desperate and resigned to losing all hope <>
in a voiceover he asks did you ever want to forget anything and cant because there is always something that comes up to remind you of what you were trying to forget <>
{} his bad luck in getting rides seems to change when a fancy convertible stops to pick him up in arizona and the driver charles haskell jr edmund macdonald an affable bookie tells him that hes in luck because hes heading to santa anita racetrack <>
{} after haskell treats him to a meal and they are on the road it starts to rain and when al tries to awaken him to help him pull down the convertible top he is surprised to find that haskell has died from a heart attack <>
the most memorable part of the film the part that seemed the eeriest and most convincing comes next as al starts to panic and cant think clearly <>
he goes over in his mind the choices he has as he keeps saying to himself who would believe me if i told them what happened my first instinct tells me to run <>
the next possibility is to sit tight and wait for the cops <>
{} al decides to hide the body and take off with the car and haskells wallet and drivers license <>
unfortunately when he tries to get him out of the car haskells head hits a rock making al more certain that he made the right decision to run away <>
{} seemingly homefree entering california he picks up a woman hitchhiker the femme fatale vera ann savage and she turns out to be the hitchhiker that haskell told him about the one who badly scratched him up after he tried to make a pass at her <>
vera is a truly rotten person and holds him prisoner in her attempt to make a killing on this fortuitous turn events for her <>
she threatens al that she will go to the police unless he gives her all of haskells money which he does without a fight <>
but when she insists they go into los angeles and sell the car he stalls just wanting to get away from her <>
{} haskell had told them both the same sad story about running away from home at after putting a friends eye out in a duel with his dads francoprussian sabers <>
while trying to sell the car in los angeles vera reads that haskells rich father is dying and schemes for al to impersonate the longlost son and inherit the estate <>
while waiting for the old man to die they sit in a dinghy hotel room and argue until the drunken vera goes in the other room to call the police after he refuses to go along with the scheme and al accidently kills her when he pulls on the telephone cord not seeing that it was wrapped around her neck <>
{} his destination is now on a detour as he decides he cant see sue like he is and turns back to the diner in nevada where he is hitching a ride in the rain back east feeling only bad things can happen to him and as luck would have it he is picked up by the police in the films closing shot <>
{} al has made his case to the audience and like a true noir protagonist life has kicked him where he is most vulnerable <>
his weak character and not his criminal act of stealing haskells identity are the cause of his downfall <>
his struggle against fate is doomed from the start of his journey <>
his doom when rejected by the girl he loved cannot be overturned <>
what makes the film inevitably pessimistic is the mixture of passion and foolishness that follow the hero wherever he goes as he sees before him how the left and right coast hold the same dim promise for his future that the road is dark even when it is sunny <>
{} since fiction is not necessarily stranger than life this nightmarish tale echoes what happened to tom neal in real life as he would serve six years in prison for killing his wife <>
{} ulmer has created an unusually bleak character study that plays like a mesmerizing confession as the hero has the intangible quality of innocence going for him which adds a seductive quality to his character for those in the audience such as me who can appreciate his natural inclination not to trust the authorities even when that seems to be the most rational thing to do in the dire predicament he was in <>
for some being outside the system is as natural as walking in the fog <>
to understand that is to begin to understand the power of a noir film probably the most original cinematic work the american film industry has produced <>
the noir hero is just not like the other hollywood heroes he does not see the world in technicolor <>

{} the opening scene paints a deceptively pretty postcard picture of this small new hampshire town lawford covered with a late fall snow as a young school aged girl wearing a red halloween mask jill brigid is guardedly speaking to her policemancrossing guard father wade nolte asking him if he was bad as a child doing halloween pranks as he warily but unsuccessfully tries to respond to her in his car as they have just left his exwifes place which is in another town about a hour away and are heading for a childrens halloween party he arranged with his boss the town selectman gordon lariviere holmes especially for her sake even though she doesnt feel comfortable with the town or with him <>
his former wife lillian mary beth hurt who married him twice and is now married to someone else can no longer relate to him and his angry mood swings <>
{} after dropping jill off at the party she doesnt want to be at wade leaves the party being held at his police station to go off smoking some weed with his much younger friend and fellow snowplower for the town the complacent jack hewitt true who shares many of wades feelings about the town they were both born in but who is mostly pining about his chance to play minor league baseball for the bosox coming to an abrupt end and how he is now broke and everything seems to be leading to a deadend <>
{} we soon see that jill really does not enjoy the visitation she has with her emotionally distraught father even as she tells him that she loves him she still cant wait to get back home to her loving mother <>
a nasty scene develops as jill reacts to her unhappiness at being there by calling her mother and asking to be taken home and when the mother arrives with her husband wade goes slightly ballistic scaring the hell out of the child <>
{} there is a voiceover and the rich discernible voice of willem dafoe rolfe is heard as he relates that this is a story about two brothers who were afflicted by pain and violence by an abusive and alcoholic father glen coburn and this is the story as told from his point of view about the criminality of his brother and how it can be explained <>
but for most of the film it is through wades narrow focus that we see what is taking place <>
we dont even get to see rolfe until about after an hour of the film has elapsed but even though he has distanced himself from his family situation teaching now at boston university he keeps daily contact by phone with his older sibling who rattles on about his divorce telling him that he is going to concord to get a lawyer foolishly thinking he can get custody of the children as he also rants about his personal bitterness and the emotional difficulties he is constantly having <>
since rolfe pictures himself as the survivor of the family the less physical of the two he tries to help out wade with his more rational insights grateful that his brother had acted as a protector for him when they were growing up in a house with a demonic father and an angelic mother but a mother who seemed helpless against the rages of her husband <>
{} this is another russell banks novel based film that has been wellsuited for the big screen a recent one was the more personally meditative the sweet hereafter <>
affliction depicts how a man can go over the edge just lose it completely one day and that there is nothing anyone can do to prevent it <>
the inward turmoil of wade is constantly being stirred by all the disappointments he feels about himself and his memories which are magnified by what he experiences daily in this small town <>
outwardly we see how run down he has become even if he has stopped drinking <>
his constant toothache and not going to see a dentist is overworked symbolically into the story but it does show how he is also afflicted with physical pain that he cant readily handle and how he eventually painfully solves this problem by pulling his aching tooth out with a pair of pliers <>
{} when jack takes an influential visitor from massachusetts mccann out hunting and he shoots himself by accident wade backed up by his brothers shared opinion thinks that this isnt an accident but perhaps a professional hit done by the mafia or by jack because the visitor had enemies in his union <>
when wade becomes obsessive about the accident ranting on to jack and his boss about their part in the crime his brother tries to tell him that he was mistaken in thinking it was anything other than an accident that he should forget about it and just concentrate on straightening out his own problems <>
{} wades one chance for genuine affection is with the local waitress maggie spacek who cares for him deeply and is willing to put up with a lot of his unpleasantries because she knows his situation and how much he has been hurt <>
there is the tragic visit she makes with wade to his parents house where he introduces her to his dad in a visit to check on how his dad is doing that is so draining for wade as she acts as a buffer between him and his still verbally abusive elderly father <>
but the visit ends upon the discovery that his mother froze to death because his father failed to get anyone to fix the furnace <>
{} because we see the accident through wades neurotic eyes we are never quite sure what it is we have seen but by the time the movie winds down and wade unravels we see how pervasive corruption is in this economically depressed town and we hope that wade can move in that direction to get the guilty culprits instead of chasing something he might have imagined <>
but since this story is mostly a psychological thriller we are caught in the web of noltes very compelling characterization as he is someone who puts us into his shoes so that we cant help seeing what a tormented person he is and are really unsure for the time being whether a crime was committed or not until by the films end then everything seems to come into place and we realize how far gone wade has become <>
nolte is so good in this role that we can actually feel wades traumas reverberating within us <>
{} the other standout performances come from brigid tierney who almost steals the film from the veteran actors nolte and coburn because of how genuine she comes across in her very pertinent role as a young child having to distance herself from a father she is afraid to love <>
coburn is convincingly good as the coldhearted father who recognizes that his older son has inherited his traits <>
his iconoclastic and memorable portrayal of an abusive father is very hard hitting and original <>
holmes osborne and jim true look and act as if they stepped out of the streets in rural new england and were actually who they portrayed on screen <>
sissy spacek was her usual sweet self <>
these characterizations made the bleakness of the story delightfully credible and penetrating <>
{} living in a small new england town myself i can attest to how uncannily realistic the town and the people in it appeared to be <>
{} schrader the director of taxi driver is so uniquely suited to do this type of film as he makes the most of this absorbing look into these troubled men psyches holding up a mirror of truth to see if it is still possible for those who are so troubled to see themselves in someone else and to astutely ascertain what it is they are doing to themselves <>
one of wades greatest fears was that he was becoming like his father <>
{} creating a portrait of how a dysfunctional family is without being trite about it is not that easy to accomplish especially since this kind of subject matter is old news by now <>
but this film accomplished that by creating an edgy mood piece that has to be watched carefully because it is filled with plenty of jewels for those who are willing to dig them out in the dark spaces they are to be found in where one mans plight becomes something that can be so universally felt <>
{} that is not to say that this film didnt have moments of reaching too far afield and failing miserably such as trying to make wade out to be a christ figure while as a crossing guard he freezes at not seeing his daughter going to school and stretches his arms out in a crucified position as mel gordon adams representing new money in town disrespectfully speeds by him <>
that representation is not the wade we see for most of the film the wade who is the local good guy willing to get along with all the other locals until he loses his equilibrium <>
that is the more accurate portrayal of the volatile wade who is also capable of taking someones life and not capable of overcoming his horrible childhood <>

{} he idolized fellini who he wrote for and who gave him a chance to shoot a film for the first time but which was not accepted by fellini as a good enough work for him to use <>
the result was that pasolini left fellini and made his directorial debut in a film which covered the seamy side of life in rome accattone <>
it was different in style than other films at the time and was received very well by the critics <>
he concentrated on films during this period as the gospel according to st matthew exemplifies the mystic character in the simple faces of those involved with the preacher christ as he politically rails against an unjust society that condones waste and corruption <>
his christ even curses those thieves of the people <>
for pasolinis christ sin is only a crime against daily servitude <>
oedipus rex was the film that was closest to his upbringing where the hero slays his father and sleeps with his mother <>
that is destiny and it cant be changed the myth which pasolini believed that so forcefully concurs with his own beliefs <>
the film turned out to be visually satisfying to audiences though not pleasing all the critics <>
the last film he made was his most controversial and decadent salo <>
here he decides to tell the truth as it isnot as he imagines it is <>
he relates the consumer culture with its intent being to keep selling their product comparing it with hitlers need to collect human bodies <>
through all kinds of sexual debasements and perversities that are shown in this poorly received film pasolini attempted to make his point about current italian society being like fascism <>
that he should die so violent a death did not surprise everyone especially since he led such a nonconformist existence one where violence always seemed to be a part of his life even though he was not a violent person himself <>
{} the yearold pelosi the accused murderer was sentenced to years in jail as a youthful offender and the italian press had a field day vilifying pasolini for his moral decadence almost saying that it was his fault his homosexuality caused the crime <>
pasolini the decadent antifascist procommunist homosexual artist is a key figure in trying to come to grips with modern italy and its many passions this documentary provides some useful fodder about him whether you are a novice to him or have followed his career fully <>
interestingly enough he was working on a book about some kind of modern paul coming to america to sell his religious beliefs before his brutal murder <>
{} one thing i can say for sure about pasolini is that he is always interesting even if he isnt always understood <>
this documentary gives one a good quicklook at him and should encourage those who are so inclined to checkout his films or books if they havent done so before <>

{} trace jordan tab comes across his rancher brother john too late as he gets gunned down in the movies opening scene while chopping wood by three desperadoes who dont even give him a chance to draw his gun <>
all the audience sees of them is from their belt buckle down to their boots as the lame wes tyler the fancy mexican spur wearing shooter mort earl and the vicious cigar chomping jack sutton skip who is the son of joe sutton teal the big boss and cattle baron who hired them to do the shooting nonchalantly kill traces brother and then head back to the towns bar <>
the reason mr sutton orders the killings is because he doesnt want any settlers coming into the valley his plan is to own the whole valley and not give the settlers a chance to squat on the land as he knows before long the land will be properly deeded and those squatting on the land will then legally own it <>
so begins this hearty revenge western that was scripted by irwing wallace before he went on to become a successful novelist <>
{} trace goes right after the killers and forces his way into mr suttons walledin ranch by overtaking the guard braun hal and marching him into the office where the boss is discussing business with his ranch foreman ben akins <>
when trace requests to speak to the boss privately sutton agrees and then trace accuses his hired hands of killing his brother and stealing his horses and wants them turned over to the fort in the next town for a military trial <>
with that accusation out of the way sutton denies it and then pulls a gun out of his desk drawer and fires wounding trace but trace is able to fire back and severely wounds the old patriarch <>
{} trace goes on the run being chased by all of suttons hired hands but he manages to escape and is found by a stream near the abandoned mining shaft where the beautiful and spunky mexican halfbreed maria wood lives with her weakwilled uncle puglia and her cowardly brother tony <>
her father was a white settler who took a mexican for his wife and was shot by suttons men so that he couldnt settle on the land <>
but there was no proof who did it and since theres no sheriff in town to investigate the crime sutton gets away with his claim that it was the comanches who did it <>
{} this is fairly trite water we are treading on the only minor twist to the story comes about when the loyalty of ben is questioned by the suttons and when ben refuses to let jack beat it out of maria where trace is hiding <>
for his troubles he is shot in the back by jack <>
there is disloyalty on marias side also as her brother afraid of what the men might do to maria and himself tells the killers where trace is hiding <>
but maria outfoxes them and spikes their coffee with jimson weed and they conk out while she escapes to warn trace <>
i think the writers got their facts mixed up about the affects of the poisonous weed as i believe it acts as an hallucinogenic or as a poison that can kill you but it doesnt necessarily cause drowsiness and especially not when put into caffeine <>
{} the killers force a tracker franz to get them to trace and he agrees but will not agree to be a participant in the shooting of trace <>
when challenged by jack to find trace or else this halfbreed his father was a dutch settler and his mother a ute leads the posse into an ambush where the comanches pick off all of the men except for wes and jack and the tracker <>
{} by this time trace and maria have found love ontherun <>
the story was trying desperately to say that interracial love was okay and by having the heroic figures of the story be halfbreeds this film is going as far as it wants to go with that tolerant attitude <>
it is just too bad that tab is such a vanilla actor and natalie is earnest but unconvincing in her role as a halfbreed <>
their romance has no fire in it it was almost like it was a pedantic exercise in virtue that we were witnessing <>
with more suitable actors in the starring roles this could have been a much more relevant film <>
{} the only actor with some life to him was skip homeier but he was too much of a caricature of evil for his character to be anything but cardboardlike manic <>
the action fight scene at the films end was classical western stuff shooting at each other running out of bullets a fist fight on the rocky hillside and then a fight to the finish in the fastcurrent stream <>
{} eduard franz added dignity to his role as the noble tracker sharing his wisdom as he states in the art of tracking what is important is to find something that is out place <>
what was out place about this film was that despite the beautiful photography and gripping action scenes the story covered no new ground though it had its opportunities but it failed to take advantage of them <>
what remains solid about the film is that if you get off on watching a western with a revenge motive then this one never strays from that motive <>

that is what the almost yearold shohei imamura black rainvengeance is minethe insect womanthe pornographersthe eel does here in his final film after a long and illustrious career one in which he started out as an assistant to the great director yasujiro ozu <>
this is a comedydrama about the last days of ww that is shot inside a resisting japan trying to hold back their inevitable defeat and staying the course under orders from their totalitarian regime <>
the story takes place in the small backwater seacoast town of hibi where those who wish to forget the war might go to the towns red light district or drown their sorrows with alcohol or drugs <>
dr akagi akira emoto is something of local joke and comical figure in town called by most dr liver because he diagnosiss all his patience as having hepatitis and is always seen in his immaculate white suit straw hat bow tie and knickers running around town tending to his patients <>
they treat himeven if they kid him a bitas a local treasure <>
he seems to have their best interest at heart and he cures them of their ills and they know this but the ones in charge dont seem to care and treat him as if he were a quack <>
{} imamura whose own father was a doctor based this film on a short novel by ango sakaguchi yet imamura and his son who collaborated on the script under the pseudonym daisuke tengan have supposedly retained only the title character and invented everything else <>
i have not read the book to confirm this but this is what the director said in an interview that was reported by a film zine <>
{} what struck me as rather odd for the moment until i thought further about it was the films opening as the first words spoken are english that come from american bomber pilots flying over okayama an island village next to the doctors hometown of hibi with a pow camp and a factory <>
this seems to indicate the influence america and its film industry has had on this quintessential japanese director and the need he has to show that the world is not necessarily a homogenous place that all nations are influenced by each other <>
he will even have his good doctor at one point of the story converse in german with a dutch pow piet jacques gamblin accused of being a spy <>
it sets the table for the films major theme that war comes about when people cant trust each other anymore and that they let their governments take charge of their thinking process <>
this is what happened to japan <>
therefore how could you blame the american pilots who are now carrying out their mission to end the war even if they are doing something as terrible as bombing a civilian population <>
it is a rather odd philosophical opinion for one to have especially for one who was himself getting bombed during the war imamura was a teen at the time of the war <>
{} in a more prosaic meaning for the films opening the bombing interrupts the sexual act of the local prostitute sonoko kumiko aso with her boyfriend who is paying her for sex by embezzling funds from city hall where he is an accountant <>
his mother disheartened by this relationship will accept dr akagis advice and seek the advice of the local priest umemoto jyuro kara on what to do <>
he is a drunk unhappily living with his third wife and demands sake for his services but gets pickled cucumbers instead <>
no one in this film will get exactly what they want <>
{} this is a chaotic story that covers more topics than you could shake a stick at <>
they range from some more or less minor concerns such as whale fishing prostitution bureaucracy power trips smalltown superstitions a virgin will be more likely to get shot in war than an experienced man smalltown prejudices a prostitute is not good enough for my son pows being tortured japans attitudes towards foreigners and grave desecration dr akagi will need a liver for his research <>
the big themes are reserved for what role society has in providing medical research into the cause and identification of hepatitis the finding of love in ones life the nuclear bomb and finding out what causes a war <>
{} this imamura film is not by any means his definitive one but it shows enough of his lifetime concerns to be an interesting one for him to make his swan song in <>
what it suffers from is that the combination of comedy and serious drama have too many awkward and slow moments that show many reactions to what the director visibly feels and makes them look as if they were predictably put into the cluttered story and dont have a breath of their own <>
to see how great a director he is is to contrast those tepid scenes with some of the scenes that have his magical hand in it and see how simple and moving they were <>
the last scene of the film is the work of a master as the cloudlike nuclear bomb is viewed by the middleaged widower dr akagi who is bereaved having recently learned that his doctor son serving in manchuria probably involved in immoral research on live subjects captured by the japanese had been killed <>
with akagi accepting him as a great man not a quack is his young assistant sonoko a former prostitute taken on by him as a favor to those who want to save her from being a prostitute <>
she has fallen in love with the older man because she thinks he is great person and is ready to let him have sex with her for free as she recalls her mothers keiko advice who trained her to be a whore dont give a man a freebie unless he is your true love <>
the two are returning from a medical call made to one of the remote islands and she has just missed catching a whale tipping over the small boat but nonetheless feels exhilarated and shows off her nude body to the modest doctor and in the background appears the nuclear bomb something that they dont recognize for what it is at first as it looks godly and spectacularly magnificent as if it could temporarily solve all the problems that plagued the world and end all worldly conflict <>
there is no moral judgment that this is an american bomb as it seems the philosophy here is that when you live by the sword you must expect to die that way <>
the better choice for his country would have been one of practising a more loving nature something that seems obvious but what is also obvious is that the world has not learned that simple lesson and continues to rely on military might to fight its battles <>
behind imamuras kindly doctor alter ego there is a despondency that the sickness of his country couldnt be cured and so much needless suffering for his people and the world had to take place <>
{} dr akagi is fighting a singlehanded battle in war time japan to alert the country that hepatitis is a contagious disease and it is destroying the liver so that it can no longer process toxins and therefore it is destroying the body <>
he treats his victims with glucose which the local army pow commmandant says is being misused by him <>
what imamura is also pointing out is that this disease is symptomatic to what is happening in japan it is destroying the country because the problem is being ignored and the disease and the war are similar in nature they are rapidly spreading unchecked across the country <>
{} to enlist his help in the battle against hepatitis the doctor is only able to muster the support of those with weaknesses in their character who are not esteemed members of the community but in their hearts are good people and when given a chance will try to work through their problems <>
these people are the drunken monk the morphine addicted surgeon sera the dutch fugitive from the pow camp and the somewhat exprostitute sonoko she still plies her trade when convenient <>
{} in one conversation between akagi and sonoko the beauty of their characters is magnified as the deadly bacteria is viewed under the microscope and sonoko on seeing it exclaims how beautiful it is sonoko are there men and women bacteria <>
akagi neither male nor female just perpetual reproductive motion <>
sonoko no prostitution <>
akagi that doesnt exist in nature <>
everyone copulates freely <>
only humans value chastity <>
still prostitution is bad since you were born among humans <>
sonoko better off being bacteria more fun <>
{} the big events of the film center around dr akagi getting a microscope and a liver and movie equipment with a powerful arc light needed to view the bacteria from a patient of his who dies and by him going to tokyo and enlisting and getting support for his project from his educated and prominent colleagues <>
the praise and applause he receives for his efforts at a reception is enough to make anyone filled with pride and that euphoric rush allowing the doctor to forget for once that his patients come first its prideful affect on him is seen on his return and makes him realize he cant let such pride rule his life <>
he sees this when he fails to immediately respond to an old lady with a heart attack instead he is busy working at his microscope and she dies the next day <>
{} things really come to a summit on his return from tokyo when he finds that the army is looking for the escaped pow <>
sonoko tells him that she hid him in the house and the doctor without hesitating he is willing to help any human being in trouble operates on the tortured fugitive with the help of his oddball friends <>
one good turn leads to another as the dutchman in civilian life was an expert in cameras and gets the microscope needed for the hepatitis research to work properly <>
{} when the army recaptures him and they take the doctors equipment he realizes that he he cant stop what seems to be destined <>
that the war and the disease cannot be cured as of now <>
{} this film might not be a masterpiece which i dont think it is but it is clearly a film by a great man a man who sees the contradictions in life in an amusing and contentiously cynical way someone who can put the virtuous doctor in the same boat with the whore and not be bothered by any moral judgments about who the better person is because to him they are both beautiful <>
and in the same breath he can understand all those in japan who served their emperor even the pow commandant whom he views as not that different from dr akagi in his allegiance to authority <>
they both have connections to the rulers of the country and use this influence when it suits their purposes <>

{} an unconscionable clinker for those who are more impressed with intellect in films than with special effects for a film costing million dollars to make while doing a dutiful job in recreating the grandeur of the ship and its ritzy atmosphere but failing in everything else except in the gall to think it has created a masterpiece <>
if there is anyone out there who stills believes there is such a thing as an unsinkable ship youll believe leonardo dicaprios innocuous portrayal of an artist on board the illfated ship and that the soap opera story told is tantamount to a work of art <>
this epic disaster film of the titanics sinking upon hitting an iceberg on april is all gloss highclass trash something that is so opulently hollywood so much so that it deserved to win an oscar and set box office records for the audacity to perceive itself as the official version of what happened to the titanic while even in its quest for accuracy it still does not play up the fact that a nearby ship refused to come in time to save those who were in the water freezing to death thereby causing the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of the hundred that were found to be dead out of the two thousand and two hundred passengers on board <>
films backed by big money like this one rarely ever go after controversy much preferring to steer a troublefree course with a clever eye to the bottom line <>
{} this three hour and eleven minute disaster film opens with a team of deep sea explorers led by brock lovett bill paxton looking for the titanics treasures and the valuable jewels it had on board <>
these slick treasure hunters are disappointed that their found booty has turned to mud and that the only thing they have come up with is a nude picture of a woman with the worlds most valuable blue eggshaped diamond necklace le coeur de la mer around her neck <>
but to their surprise they receive a call from the lady who posed for that picture who is now a yearsold <>
and the film begins its flashback of what happened to the titanic narrated through the eyes of rose gloria who in reallife is an yearold former actress who appeared in the gold diggers of <>
{} immediately we see this is going to be a class war struggle piece with the haughty rich boarding on first class passage and the lowerclass in steerage and they are shown to be living their lives in starkly different worlds <>
the first one we see to board from first class is the gorgeous and well plumed rose kate with her snooty mother francis and the man she is soon to be married to the wealthy scion to his families business cal but the catch is that she cant stand him as he is played hideously and onedimensionally by zane <>
by way of steerage comes our boy jack dawson leonard who wins his ticket in a card game <>
all the lowerclass people are the salts of the earth while all the upperclass people are snobs <>
there is one exception the unsinkable molly brown who represented the class of new money she is played without creating any further interest in her character by kathy bates who seems to be going through the motions of what the character is like <>
i think any actress on board that ship could have played that part <>
it is hard to believe how trite and contrived this story was and how everyone in this film had no depth of character <>
everyone was a wooden stereotype of what their class status was supposed to be like <>
what gave this film watch ability was the way the ship was recreated down to its last details giving one the romantic feeling that one was on the real voyage <>
at least the money spent for visual effects went to some good usage <>
{} the love story begins when jack stops rose from jumping overboard as she is apparently confused about her situation and contemplates suicide <>
the remainder of the film is about these starcrossed lovers trying to get together but being opposed by her mother and her future husband who acts in a pompous manner becoming the ready made villain of this story never changing his intonations for one moment <>
{} the other part of the film focuses on the ships management telling the captain to speed things up and the intrepid captain against his better judgment is obliging to that wish supposedly for the publicity the ship would get if it docked in new york ahead of schedule <>
what was ultimately unforeseen was that the weather created conditions that made it impossible to detect icebergs which the ship rammed into at full speed <>
{} the photography was great <>
the costumes were terrific <>
the sound system was as good as it gets <>
everything about the special effects was firstclass <>
if you judge a film by those standards then you will be more than pleased with this film <>
if you are looking for a cruise into deeper water then im afraid you boarded the wrong film this one will only leak all over you <>
i waited a long time to see this film choosing to watch it on tv and not on a big screen theater i have no regrets why i waited so long <>
by the way i saw a night to remember and thought that version of the titanic to be just grand not cluttered with a trivial story just sticking to the suspense of the historical event which was fine and dandy by my non technical cerebral standards <>

{} set in bosnia during and the story swings back and forth in time from the breakup of titos unified yugoslavia to the present exyugoslavia <>
a tunnel erected in to symbolize the path of brotherhood and unity linking zagreb to belgrade is depicted in fake newsreels to show how everything went wrong it is then shown ten years later when it is left abandoned and becomes the scene of battle for the film <>
{} this bleak tale is told from the pointofview of the serb soldier who is severely wounded in a belgrade hospital in and flashes back to his childhood and the war and the hopes that died with tito even if he was a liar and a scoundrel at least the country was unified <>
it is allegedly based upon a true story one that echoes the directors universal appeal for everyone to end all their hatred <>
{} the plot focuses upon the longtime friendship of muslim halil nikola pejakovic and serbian milan dragan bjelogrlic who grow up in peacetime as best friends in a small village and become partners in an auto repair shop <>
they shared a common fear of the ogre that lives in their local abandoned tunnel <>
each child was determined even in the childhood games they played to not give up until they won as their somewhat happy childhood is shown in flashbacks <>
when the ethnic war is waged in their country they now face each other as enemies as halils side traps milans side in an abandoned tunnel <>
{} milans mother is brutally killed and halils home is destroyed as they become symbols for the maddening war that is taking place as even these friends cant even trust each other anymore and have been drawn into the hatred of the conflict <>
the bitter war seems almost to be inevitable in this over two hour film told in a detached style emphasizing the bloody battles as it clearly shows how war is both hell and insanity <>
{} there are some vintage moments a peace corps chanting give peace a chance outside a war hospital those trapped in the tunnel drinking urine out of a dietcoke bottle to stay alive and milan climbing out of his hospital bed with an uncontrollable rage and crawling on the floor to get vengeance on a muslim wounded prisoner of war who is behind a glass partition <>
{} if the film could be faulted it is that everyone in it is used as a symbol which takes away some of the spontaneity of their individualism so the characters dont really stick with us as much as the arson of the villages does and all the other catastrophes that result from the war <>
a soldier says pretty villages are pretty when they burn ugly ones stay ugly even when they burn <>
as the soldiers burn a village without even knowing its name <>
{} pretty village pretty flame mostly takes place inside the musty tunnel among the trapped serb troops who are running out of water led by a communist captain eagerly recalling the good old days under tito <>
among the beleaguered platoon of soldiers facing periodic muslim assaults and psychological taunts being called chetniks are a thief a drug addict forced to join the army or go to prison and a professor <>
they are joined by a young american television journalist who sneaked on their truck carrying a muslim visa and a video camera and who does not speak serbian <>
she becomes the symbol of the united states and its unwillingness to intervene to stop the genocide <>
{} this is a disturbing film not one that is easy to watch even as its gallows humor tries to lessen the somber tone of the story <>
its vivid images the villages burning were taken from real newsreels leave a bitter impression and very little hope for the future <>
to understand this conflict is to understand how modern yugoslavia was carved up among the different ethnic groups by other countries and how these conflicts have a long history behind them <>
if the director blames the united states and the rest of the world for not doing something he clearly must blame his own countrymen first <>

{} mirrors should reflect a little before throwing back images jean cocteau <>
{} the information i derived on jean cocteau the eternal returnbeauty and the beastles enfants terriblesorpheus french poet artist novelist playwright and movie director was gathered from several books with parker tylers classics of the foreign film in particular being an invaluable source <>
{} cocteau was born in maisonslafitte into a wealthy parisian family <>
his father was a lawyer and amateur painter who committed suicide when cocteau was nine <>
cocteaus father had a lasting influence on his son but according to psychoanalytical critics this tragic event also created his desire to put himself in the service of the arts and the mysterious forces in the universe <>
in secondary school cocteau was only a mediocre student who was unsuccessful after repeated attempts to pass the graduation examination <>
his first volume of poems aladdins lamp cocteau published at the age of and gained fame with his involvement as writer and supervisor in parade a ballet produced by serge de diaghile with sets by pablo picasso and music by erik satie <>
{} the idea of a film came about during a house party given by charles and marielaure de noailles at hyeres in <>
georges auric cocteaus lifelong musical collaborator said that he wanted to compose the score for an animated cartoon <>
cocteau was asked to provide a scenario <>
the noailles who also bankrolled luis buels lage dor agreed to give cocteau a million francs to make a liveaction film with a score by auric <>
this became the blood of a poet still one of the most widely viewed of all cocteaus screenworks <>
{} cocteau described this first film of his as a disturbing series of voyeuristic tableaux as a descent into oneself a way of using the mechanism of the dream without sleeping a crooked candle often mysteriously blown out carried about in the night of the human body <>
{} the blood of a poet was based on his own private mythology <>
typical for cocteaus films was the use of mirrors as a door into another world and the play between reality and the underworld or the inner world where poetry is made <>
the hostility of the surrealists to this project led cocteau to make a film that is sometimes in structure a lot closer in resemblance to neoromantic classicism than surrealism andre breton was king of the surrealist group and was afraid cocteau would dethrone him <>
{} there has never been a film quite like le sang dun poete <>
cocteau used all his energy and his diverse talents in a medium that was new to him as this film represented an aesthetic milestone in his career <>
{} was it nonsense or serious filmmaking <>
in my opinion a little of both though the result of the film is a serious work <>
this minute film is ostensibly a work on the nature of creating art <>
it shows the artist in the first part of the film struggling to find his identity vowing to free himself from his present confinement by becoming a martyr for his art <>
he symbolically kills himself to attain a new relationship to tradition <>
in the second part he dredges up events from his young life and tries to honestly see himself for the first time without being conditioned by the world he grew up in <>
playing a card game with a lady the poet snaps and starts recalling distresses from his childhood and again symbolically shoots himself <>
his opponent turns into his muse her long black gloves simulating a statues absence of arms <>
{} technically the blood of a poet reflects cocteaus trials and errors as a novice filmmaker who had to turn irreversible mistakes to his advantage and had to constantly improvise <>
during shooting he used the dust raised by studio cleaning men to enhance the mysterious atmosphere of the final scenes <>
special weightless effects were obtained by camera trickery to show the little girl flying up to the ceiling and the poet moving painfully along the corridor wall <>
once cocteau discovered that he could turn shooting disasters into excellent footage he was off on a career of making films that carried his trait of creating trick shots the miraculous mirror and mercury scene in orphee the live arms holding the candelabra from the walls of la belle et la bete and the accelerated time sequences of flowers opening in le testament dorphee are only a few examples of the trick shots he used in his later films <>
{} basically in the blood of a poet cocteau shot four episodes in the life of an artist by trying to get into the artists head <>
cocteau as narrator boldly states when an expression of art collides with a laymans view of things if the work is not understood it is a question of which of the two is at fault <>
for cocteau poetry is a coatofarms <>
{} in the first episode entitled the wounded hand the poet rivero has his thoughts surrealistically swirling in the air and a mouth forms in his hand begging for air to breath <>
the following morning the poet decides that it is not a crazy idea to awaken a statue lee even one that has been around for thousands of years as he struggles to bring it to consciousness <>
{} in the second episode he enters the mirror and it opens up a reality he never saw before as the films theme revolves around the fears and joys and obsessions of the artist who has opened himself up for analysis <>
{} in the third episode the dreams and events in the poets life come back to haunt him <>
most notable is the famous scene of the poet as a child being knocked out when hit by a snowball <>
the child must learn how to handle the obstacles in his life such as the bully in his class <>
{} the fourth episode entitled stolen card a black angel feral hovers over a dead child he was a guardian of the poet as a boy <>
there is also the boy growing up to be the artist who commits suicide at the card table <>
this is perhaps a reminder that cocteaus father committed suicide or of cocteaus artist friends who live an impoverished life and are forced to make life and death decisions <>
the film ends with the message mortal tedium of immortality <>
in the last frame an industrial chimney shown in the beginning of the film finally collapses and all material things are crushed <>
only the poet remains and is considered to be eternal <>
{} so much of this film is mysterious and vague undoubtedly autobiographical in content and motif cocteau himself always denied the presence of hidden symbolism in the film but word got about that it had antichristian undercurrents <>
this was really not so according to cocteau but the false rumor did its damage <>
it greatly distressed the noailles <>
it caused a scandal and the viscount was on the verge of being expelled from the elegant jockey club and was even threatened with excommunication from the church <>
the noailles forbade cocteau to allow public release of the blood of a poet for over a year <>
later on they gave the rights of the film to auric and cocteau allowing them to do whatever they wanted with it <>
{} the lifeline of the movie is its imagery which can be interpreted many different ways emphasizing cocteaus view that art disclaimed the world of ordinary appearances and projected vision to be a symbolic representation that must be continually changing because if it doesnt it will be dead like classicism is and it will cease to exist <>
the director was afraid that the avantgarde movement would die one day like all other artistic movements have <>
to continue to be viable the artist must break the natural laws that govern appearances and these strategies for breaking down appearances are the very gist of the film <>
the avantgarde art must be a kind of public affront <>
{} because of its unusual theme and style and unpredictability this is a film that deserves the high accolades many film critics have bestowed upon it <>
it resolutely shows how the filmmaker communicates into the spirit world and he does so without being pretentious <>

{} a secondrate watchable noir film distinguished by its gritty authentic nyc location shots and the lack of acting ability exhibited by this largely unknown cast and the lowlevel crime committed where the detective jokes that this crime didnt even make it into the daily news <>
the plot centers around a murder investigation of a woman who is killed with a shotgun and found in a stolen car in central park <>
the police dont know who she is who did the crime or where she was murdered apparently her body was dumped here from another location <>
{} lt corrigan walter kinsella the veteran detective and detective tobin john miles rookie homicide detective are the lead investigators in a case which will take them across nyc from the beautiful botanical gardens in the bronx to the dinghy tattoo parlors in the bowery and by the brooklyn navy yard and finally to a gravestone cutting site in the bronx where the climactic shootout takes place <>
{} the hero of this tale is the awkwardly nice college boy war hero cop tobin <>
he doesnt seem like he is an actor or a cop but he does appear as if he is a genuinely nice person which in the long run might prove better for humanity but it doesnt help this film a film that could have used something more from him to spark this ordinary tvlike crime drama <>
this trite subplot tried so often of the crusty veteran corrigan who is suspicious of the rookie tobin questioning his previous experience in the forensic lab afraid he will be useless to him since he hasnt been tested in the field <>
the rookie must therefore prove himself before he is to be accepted <>
{} finding an exotic type of grass in the car the bachelor rookie is sent to the museum of natural history where the expert on that kind of flora is the attractive mary mahan patricia barry a perfect love match for our hero as they will stay on that clue for the remainder of the film <>
corrigan in the meantime has figured out that the dead lady is a waitress and when they visit her in the morgue a drunk tries to carve out the tattoo on her wrist <>
when he panics and takes off as the cops approach him he is killed by tobin who saves corrigan from being killed by him <>
{} this takes them hunting down tattoo parlors where they find an amiable tattoo artist who goes by the monicker the electric rembrandt jarrett <>
he recognizes the woman from the picture of the doubletattoo the cops show him of a u s marine corps emblem and one of a navy anchor <>
they soon discover that the victim has many names that she has been married four times and collects insurance benefits from her dead husbands <>
the twist in the story is that her first husband isnt dead as believed it seems he jumped ship just before the ship he was on sunk and the cops are now sure he is their mad murderer <>
{} the poor tattoo artist gets hammered to death by the killer as he is intent on rubbing out any witness to his crimes <>
why he goes on this rampage is never made clear except it is surmised that he might be the jealous type <>
since we never hear him speak or clearly see his face we can only assume that the cops are right <>
{} the story winds up in the bronx granite yard as the killer goes there to execute the owner of the site <>
when spotted by our hero he shoots it out with him unsuccessfully among the many gravestones which makes for a colorful scene the best and most memorable one of the film <>

{} this documentary taking years to complete is a moving tribute to a biting satirical comedian who became an american icon and selfdestructed after blasting his way to success through the myriad nightclub venues on the left and right coasts of america in the sandmids <>
what seems apparent is that there was a vendetta to get him by law enforcement people across the country and that he was unfairly treated <>
he was labeled as a sick comic which turned out to be both good and bad for him <>
he had a wide audience that was ready for him but he also made many enemies those with small minds who hated him with a passion for so openly ridiculing many of their sacred cows and they made it a point to get him through the courts <>
his story begins in long island n y raised primarily by his divorced mother sally marr she died in who was a free spirit working as a bartender housecleaner and dance instructor <>
she brought lenny up to be guiltfree and independent and to be a notso nice jewish boy even taking him to strip shows when he was a teenager <>
while at the beauty parlor she is interviewed for the film filling us in with a more complete look at lenny as she provided anecdotes snapshots and home films of him and recalled how he was a quiet child who could have fits of melancholy but was a happygolucky person most of the time <>
{} after joining the navy during ww and getting discharged under a mutual agreement the showbiz bug bit him and he honed a safe but eccentric comedy act mainly doing impersonations of stars like bogart <>
in the early s he got his big break on the arthur godfrey show and pleased arthur with his clean act <>
from this tv show came bookings to clubs across the country <>
soon he got married to a stripper named honey which resulted reluctantly for him in a child kitty born in <>
by this time lenny was undergoing a transformation hanging out with the band working in burlesque houses where dirty jokes were the norm and getting into booze and drugs which were common recreational pleasures for some of the performers in these places <>
{} in the dives and strip joints he liked to work at he changed his act nightly making it topical and dirty <>
he also made what he calls a z film with his wife and friends a funny lowbudget crime film that showed he basically was like the other comics willing to do anything for a laugh <>
{} now living in los angeles he was also experimenting with harder drugs such as speed cocaine and heroin and got involved in some free sex scenes in his house gatherings <>
all this helped make his marriage come apart <>
honey thinks he fully dedicated himself to his work after she walked out on him just so he could show her what a mistake she made <>
he wanted her to see him become a big star and regret that she left him <>
as his act started to tackle subjects that were not common material for humorists in the lates such as taking on organized religion talking dirty and making comedy about sexual obsessions racism drugs and the lack of american culture he became both popular and controversial <>
this prevented him from appearing on tv at a time when that was the place to get the most recognition <>
there is a rare tv clip from an unaired steve allen show where he tries to clean up his act for the tv audience keeping obscenities out of his cutting edge jokes <>
{} it is easy to say now after viewing this intimate portrayal of him that he was someone who was way ahead of his time and fearless in sticking up for what he believed in <>
and that even though he had the comedian mentality of just going after the laugh he was still able to develop into being something more than your typical comedian <>
unfortunately he couldnt control the demons inside and outside of himself and succumbed to the growing pain that was driving him to make wrongheaded decisions in his shortlife span <>
{} the interviews with honey his friends his lawyer garbus and outspoken mother all say that he was someone who was deteriorating rapidly as he fought the court system during the last two years of his life <>
his battle with the courts is a heartbreaking story of injustice <>
it became his obsession in life and caused this once slick hipster to sadly be seen losing his cool demeanor <>
it started with a false arrest in philadelphia for taking amphetamines which he had a legitimate prescription for <>
robert de niro the narrator believes that when lenny exposed a bribe to drop the charges naming the judge involved that is when police departments around the country repeatedly arrested him on obscenity charges and lenny became a marked man <>
lenny felt its become chic to arrest me this was the beginning of the end for him as clubs were closed down that booked him and he just couldnt get gigs anymore and ultimately he became a broken man who sadly pleaded with a judge i so desperately want your respect please dont lock up these words <>
his final blow came in nyc at the cafe au go go when frank hogan the district attorney charged him with violating an ancient law on the books about obscene language <>
he was convicted of this misdemeanor and sentenced to months jail time and a thousand dollar fine <>
this ruling was reversed by a higher court but it came too late for lenny <>
he died in at age from an overdose of heroin <>

{} obviously there is no such a place as pleasantville except in a sitcom <>
but pleasantville the movie and the sitcom in the movie is made into an idealized homogenous all white illusionary place where a brother and sister will be transported into this nevernever land of tv fantasy of the s and s where everyone is repressed and seen in blackandwhite sitcom form reminiscent of shows like father knows best the donna reed show and the adventures of ozzie harriet <>
{} pleasantville is a film about how selective ones memory is when it comes to nostalgia of pining for values that never existed back then but still are the values exemplified for the traditional family of the resistance to change and clashes between those in the film who become colored and those who remain in blackandwhite and about the need to be an individual and not conform <>
{} pleasantville opens in the s where a fast lifestyle and family dysfunctionality seem to be the norm <>
teenagers david tobey maguire and jennifer reese witherspoon are the twins of a troubled single parent jane who is never there for them <>
at night with their mom out on a date david is all keyed up to watch a marathon of his favorite tv program pleasantville of which he is an expert on knowing every character and minor detail about the show <>
meanwhile jenn has a heavy date with a hunk she wants to be romantic with while watching mtv <>
the twins end up fighting over the remote for the tv show they want to see and it breaks apart but bingo a tv repairman don knotts who wasnt even called by them appears at their door and gives them a new magical remote supposedly coming here because of davids true love and knowledge of the pleasantville tv show and with the new remote switched on the twins are now trapped in the tv program pleasantville taking the place of the tv siblings bud and mary sue <>
they are now in a place where people regularly say swell and keen the weather is always perfect at degrees there is no such thing as rain no colors therefore no discrimination no sex no profanity no fires firemen only rescue cats and everything is just peachy <>
their new parents are the perfect couple george william h macy and betty joan allen whose idea of marriage revolves around each of them knowing their place he works and she stays home with a smile on her face while kept busy by cleaning cooking and taking care of the children <>
{} david and jenn have a different outlook on life with him relating to the simple existence of pleasantville and upset that he cant fit in with the turbulent s he finds it hard to talk to girls his age in class he is upset to hear about incurable diseases ozone depletion and a tough job market <>
while jenn is content with the new age freedom of the s in sex and not interested in anything that is not cool <>
{} its fairly predictable what will happen once the two realize that they are transformed into an unreal tv world as the film prepares to go into its satire mold and take apart the blandness of such perfection <>
david has no problem getting right into the program while jenn calls this place nerdville and wants out immediately <>
the calendar permanently reads but the two are stuck with their s views on things <>
at school everything seems more innocent and less tense dates take place over ice cream sodas and cheese burgers and being pinned means holding hands not having sex the basketball team wins every game and there is nothing really to learn in school that is perplexing because there is nothing outside of pleasantville <>
but this changes when jenn asks questions about what is outside of pleasantville and takes her boyfriend to lovers lane for some serious sex <>
when things change colors start to appear it seems as if jennmary sue has begun to upset the universe for these naive folks <>
{} as expected the siblings cant help but disrupt this simplistic community after living in a supposedly more sophisticated time period and such things as color emotions jealousies sex conflicts makeup for women and other changes are now brought into this insular community like diseases transmitted to the modern world <>
the filmmaker then analyzes these changes on those newly affected and the result is a more troubled but more interesting people emerging <>
through special effects from digital processing flowers start taking on color and the film begins to have a modernday alice in wonderland look to it <>
{} jeff daniels plays the stunted soda shop owner mr johnson who makes betty sexually aware of herself and who blossoms when buddavid gives him art books and he discovers he can paint in colors <>
the movie makes the point that the revolutionary changes in the s came about when people became dissatisfied with the staidness of the s and began to experiment and expand their horizons <>
j t walsh is big bob the mayor of the town in an uninspiring role as the most ardent one against change <>
{} there was something that rubbed me the wrong way about this cute idea of a film besides the fact it was boring and i felt as if i was being lectured to about the obvious general ills of society <>
there are no radical new ideas presented in this film that will make me really think about these issues any differently than the films of the s would have it is as if the filmmaker is saying that s didnt have films that were critical of society but a list of such films would be very extensive marty high noon ace in the hole etc <>
this snooty attitude looking down at the past from the vantage point of a supposedly hip new age bothered me <>
afterall my impression of this film is that it really is a s sitcom merging with a s feel good type of sitcom and nothing more <>
it is basically a gimmicky film which is the only new ground it breaks selling an idea about the past that connects it with the present but doing it at the expense of telling the truth about neither the past or present <>
{} the film presumes that through the efforts of these spoiled teens that they will break through the ignorance is bliss community and bring about art and literature and a more enlightened attitude toward sex and to inspire a climate for more responsible social changes <>
the film is trying to say that the innocence of the s must be merged with the social awareness of the s and this can only be accomplished by the teenage heroes who are not afraid to take chances and change the times theyre in <>
i just didnt buy into this premise and was not convinced that i wasnt seeing anything but a superficial film <>
for instance having jennmary sue substitute her new ideas of sexual feelings by reading lady chatterleys lover instead of going out with her boyfriend and having sex seemed to me to be a phony response to what literature can offer <>
character development is a raising of consciousness that comes about only through a real inward awareness a book can only act as a catalyst for that experience <>
what is offered moviewise is just the kind of empty gestures made to genuine problems which can be found on tv programs from both yesterday and today <>
therefore it is just another empty gesture at culture trying to be cute letting the baby boomers know that its okay therere doing just fine <>
you can keep being materialists just be cool about it <>
and by not upsetting the apple cart just railing against the general ills of society the filmmaker has succeeded in tapping into a huge audience by not being probative enough allowing the films nostalgia to play for it rather than to make one really tune into the s aspect of the film it brings up about the real problems this society faces that are not being met such as families in crises situations environments being raped art and literature being more removed from mainstream america than ever before schools that cant educate most of their students effectively a continuation of bland tv programs getting more obscene is not necessarily an advancement and a society that is confused about the values it thinks are important <>
the film has simply lost track of its critique of society and has failed to show how one age has evolved from another with each age being misled by those trying to force its values onto another age <>
there was no one in this film who understood how to bridge the past with the future instead this becomes a film just like the sitcoms it parodies which means its just another escape film unable or unwilling to delve deeply into all the real problems it brings up <>

the grim nature of its story was made less austere by the films black comedy which was a staple of both films <>

{} not relying on the standard techniques used in silent films during that time frame nor on the avantgarde and surrealists vision of the radical s on debunking the church the danish filmmaker dreyer concentrated on making an intensely personal film a film that eluded any known styles <>
nevertheless he constructed an exact replica of the trial scene for this big budget film using the style of german expressionism for his set design <>
{} the passion of joan of arc featured many closeups of joan ren maria falconetti and the judges and used the symbols of the church to show the extent of its authority <>
dreyer records the story of the yearold illiterate who termed herself as frances savior who faced her accusers and challenged their authority <>
though the film appeared to be shot without any long and medium shots that was not the case <>
it just seemed that way because dreyer for reasons of getting at the truth without any other interference had made isolated shots of joan showing how alone she was from her accusers and from the soldiers and peasants watching the trial and these shots became abstractions allowing you to think of them as being solely closeups <>
it is because of this style that we are forced to concentrate only on the main players and on the truth of the trial and our attention is not diverted in any other direction <>
{} the genius of dreyer in assembling a cast that was perfectly suited for their parts is a major reason for this work of art and critically acclaimed icon in the history of filmmaking to be as absorbing as it was <>
dreyer chose as his joan a young french stage actress known for doing light comedies <>
he picked her because under her skindeep beauty and makeup he saw her soul and the simplicity of her nature <>
no actor wore makeup every attempt was made to make things seem as natural as possible <>
dreyer was rewarded with his choice for actress by getting from her one of the greatest magical performances ever seen in the history of films <>
falconetti interestingly enough never made another film but instead chose to go back to doing light comedies on the stage except for a brief respite where she repeated her joan role on the french stage <>
the rest of his casting was also inspired this time by a mixture of professional actors and those chosen in the bistros as he opted to cast for his english general warwick someone who in reallife was a cafekeeper <>
for the evil bishop he chose euge silvain who was a professional actor in his seventies best known for his work in french comedies <>
antonin artaud noted bad boy artiste of the avantgarde theater and later on noted for going mad played the sympathetic brother massieu <>
{} the films opening is a study in starkness <>
it starts off as a pair of aged hands turn the soiled pages of an old book in the next shot the past comes alive with the entrance of the ecclesiastical judges of joans trial <>
the contrasts between the two shots will be a recurring theme of the film historical events will seem to be eternal <>
as the judges settle in for the trial they are shot huddling together seemingly inonthe conspiracy to get the innocent maiden and on their glutton faces are the looks of craftiness and hypocritical sympathy for the girl they are persecuting as a witch <>
{} joan the peasant soldier hero of orleans who hears gods call to save france has been made to defer from her plans to attack paris with the kings full support <>
when she insists on carrying on her mission in some outlying cities she is captured by the french loyal to the british and turned over to the british to face her trial as a heretic <>
the film will only cover her church trial and her execution in rouen ignoring her activities as a soldier and a nationalist <>
{} she is seen in shortcropped hair at her trial answering the judges contemptuous questions as they challenge the voices she hears as being from god <>
she is asked do you believe god loves or hates the english <>
joan i know nothing about that <>
judge was the saint michael you conversed with naked <>
joan do you think god lacked the means to clothe him <>
judge why do you wear a mans dress <>
joan when i have done what god sent me to do i shall resume wearing a womans dress <>
judge what reward do you expect from god <>
joan the salvation of my soul <>
these are some of the highlights from the trial as these supposed learned men question this peasant girl and attempt to get her to say that the voices she heard came from the devil <>
{} when joan fails to respond to the questions as the judges would like the judges decide to up the ante <>
they refuse her wish to be heard by the pope saying they are the ones who are fit to serve as her judges and they allow her to become a target for taunts by the english soldiers guarding her and as an added bit of vindictiveness they even refuse to let her hear mass she will also become subject to the judges physical methods of torture <>
her retort is that any confession gained by such means she will recant when the torture stops <>
as a further cruelty she is bled and weakened even more <>
and all the time the intensity of the faces closeup and the guile of the bishop heading the interrogation is stripped to the bare essentials so that at the climax of each scene a meaning is projected into a few stark imagesa face a crown of reeds a flock of birds flying away to the cross being held by a priest spears held up by the soldiers a spikestudded wheel and a stake being prepared <>
{} the filmmaking of the trial was so austere it was easy to believe that this was the actual trial taking place <>
dreyers use of the transcripts from the trial was an ingenuous move on his part as well as having the priests tower over joan and all the shots of the priests looking and gesturing to each other conveying the nature of their evil conspiracy against her <>
{} one of the most horrifying scenes that brought genuine tears to the young actress was when she was being prepared to go to the stake and her shortcropped hair was being cut further <>
the scene was so intense that when it was being shot all the stagehands brought her flowers on that occasion and dreyer made the gesture of taking her tears gently into his hands in a moving tribute to her performance and how powerful it was <>
{} fooled into accepting the judges offer of recantation joan signs a confession renouncing her errors but when the church passes sentence on her saying they will spare her life from being burned at the stake for a punishment of perpetual imprisonment she changes her mind and chooses death <>
she tells the judges i denied god to save my life <>
she goes on to tell them that she is gods emissary she cannot change her beliefs that she was born to save france from the english and carry out gods orders and her final victory will be a spiritual one in the form of martyrdom <>
{} dreyers vision of joan was to reconstruct the external reality of joans humanity and depict her only at her trial and show how she is prepared to willingly die for what she believed in <>
the films spiritual sense of being is layed in the moral rectitude of joan and her willingness not to forego suffering <>
what captures ones imagination about dreyers version of joan and this film is almost completely his version as he all but ignored joseph delteils slight novel on which the film was based on is that dreyer recognized that joan ultimately took a stand for all those who are opposed to social authority and who are determined to be true to their own nature and are prepared to offer whatever self sacrifice is required <>
{} dreyers austere no frills style of filmmaking using mixtures of blacks and dark grays to shoot the judges hardened souls and a soft gray to focus in on joan as the camera gets fully at dreyers subjects leaving no room for doubt that this is a study in contrasts of the smug cocksure faces of contempt on the questioners the lackeys of a corrupt political government and an equally venal church authority working handinhand with each other in a trial that was rigged from the start by the english powers and the french clergy <>
in contrast is the honest gaze exhibited from the closeup of joan who seems to be so much the better of a person than those pack of phonies she is forced to look at and be condemned by that we are forced to see how the faces of evil are contrasted with the face of a good person and dreyers abstractions of sticking to the shot he takes until you see what you have to see until it grows on you leaving you with a feeling of real sorrow as she is finally burned at the stake in a trial that seemed in the film as if it took a day or two but went on for about five months in actuality <>
{} this is one of the most memorable films ever made one that is hard to forget as it ends on the bleakest of notes with joan burned at the stake in front of a group of grieving spectators <>
they begin a mini riot that is violently suppressed by the presiding english military as a rock is seen going through the church window as the church is blamed by the crowd for what the english did to her with the greater implication being how the powerful ones still rule the way the world functions and how the innocent may suffer dire consequences when they clamor for the truth they hold from within themselves <>

{} it is hard to imagine how a film about a musical genius henrik kesdi that has a renown veteran actor von sydow in it who is quite adept at playing the part called for of such a curmudgeon and unsociable giant in the annals of musical composition <>
and the film being so meritoriously scored musically as to give it the proper classical musical atmosphere for the story to take off on <>
plus it is directed by an innovative and critically acclaimed polish director known for his intellectual films that are implicit studies in character camouflage contract illumination <>
should fall so short in its ability to be a creative film and is only carried to the level of marginal respectability by the weight of the above named actor and this after a brilliant opening scene that portends to a film that will be interminably beguiling that is based on an idea for a film that is both original and captivating just baffles me as i try to ponder what went wrong and how moribund and clicheridden the story came to be <>
{} the film opens with the polish musicologist student stefan lothaire bluteau tossing in his sleep from a recurring dream in which he hears a few bars of magical music <>
he goes in the middle of the night with this news to see his music professor kern bardini who says this sound might be linked with someone he went to school with the composer henrik kesdi who had a very promising future but during ww his wife was a holocaust victim and as a protest to the cruelty of the world he has chosen to remain silent ever since <>
since kesdi is living in denmark stefan goes there to see the reclusive composer <>
{} henrik is seen in his splendid country house as a bitter crotchety infirmed yearold who has remarried a much younger woman helena miles who is willing to put up with his manipulative behavior as he claims that all he wants is to be left alone to enjoy my incontinence in private <>
{} stefan forces his way into the house of the composer even though he is not welcomed at first by being able to cure the composer of his backaches by using a divining rod and discovering a stream under his bedroom and telling the composer to switch rooms when he sleeps <>
well this cure might work on film and who knows this information might have some medical merit that i am not aware of but as part of the plot stefan as the healer ingratiating himself with the composer to break his musical silence and give it all for the world of music started to give me a headache as it reminded me of all the formula films of this nature that i have sat through in the past thinking that this easily could have been the theme of a sports film or a multitude of other films and that the splendid idea that opened the picture was about to be destroyed by contrivance and implausibility <>
o great muses where are you when the filmmaker needed you most <>
{} from here on in it is all downhill as you can already guess the glorious ending to the film of henrik creating that great score so what is left is filling in the details leading up to this grand accomplishment <>
and for that we can use an attractive young danish girl and that will come in the form of a musical secretary annette gr who will tease the young musicologist but be passionately attracted to the cunningly considerate and intellectually gifted older maestro who she will become pregnant with as helena will be very undertanding of her husbands needs and they will form a pretty odd menageatrois as stefan will depart for poland having brought goodness into the world in the form of musical genius but feeling empty inside because his love for annette is unrequited <>
{} the moral of the story centers around whether you believe ones selfsacrifice for the good of the world is a genuine and necessary one or that unfilled desires are the height of all deceits <>
these and other interesting questions could have been delved into if the plot wasnt so ludicrous and if the film wasnt so uninspired as to make it almost unbearable to stomach <>
tis a pity <>

{} things in life are not perfect <>
the beautiful winegrowing region of the rhone valley in southern france is nearly perfect but it has an eyesore two smoke stacks from the power plant that smother the natural view <>
for the yearold eric rohmer my night at maudsclaires kneeperceval le gallois who spent his career making films in the school of realism it is the natural things of life that provide him with his sense of wonder and beauty <>
to prove his point we sit through a lecture on various weeds found where the grapes grow and note how unnecessary it is to spray poison on them and harmfully affect the grapes growing there just because some people are putoff to look at them and insist on having things all tidied up <>
for him nature is perfect and only man distorts it and all he can do as a filmmaker is try to get at that natural beauty without distorting it further <>
he considers his filmmaking analogous to a religious person worshipping god <>
you could substitute him with his winemaker in the film and see that for them their work is an art not a business that she makes her wine solely for the connoisseur who recognizes that her local ce du rhe is as good as a gigondas is <>
so it is with rohmer who in actuality might not be such an exacting realist as first thought but more of an artist who happens to be a realist perhaps in the mode of a monet whose artistic work is appreciated because his water lilies mean more to him and should to us than just the flowers they are <>
{} this is a very ordinary love story between middleaged lonely people who are unable to make a connection with someone else even though they are people who have a lot to give and are far from being losers <>
we see how they are unable to be completely happy without someone to love that their work is only a small consolation for what they are missing <>
it might take a matchmaker to bring them together but what will keep them together is the love they have for a moral and physical beauty that it has to be both that attracts them in order for the romance to be complete <>
for rohmer being moral is simply living as simply as one would being natural <>
{} being a french film it is very chatty <>
it also takes a long time to develop as it makes sure that we understand all the people involved and what kind of philosophy about life they have before we come to the crux of the story <>
how the people speak and how they react to the ordinary things in life is really what rohmer is interested in <>
it is what gives this film its flavor and distinguishes its director from others of the french new wave of which he is a part of <>
{} to watch a rohmer film like he intended it to be observed is to take in the magnificence of the natural whether it is the opening of the film when we are introduced to the towns older white buildings as the light falls against them and contrasts its whiteness with its black shadows or if we view the verdant fall colors of the countryside and its sense of a cultivated peace as the sun shines on it <>
this sense of beauty has stood the test of time and is worth savoring <>
{} the middleage winemaker with the frizzy black hair and alert darkeyes is the widowed magali romand whose grown daughter and college student son live away from her <>
she confides to her close childhood friend and town bookseller isabelle riviere who visits her vineyard to invite her to her daughter emilias alcais wedding that she is not interested in having a man she is too busy with the harvest but she also confides to her that she is lonely and could be with the right man if he would just appear <>
she seems to be disconsolate about her chances of getting the right man saying at my age its easier to find buried treasure than a man isabel is struck by her neighbors plight and suggests taking out an ad in the paper but that is soundly rejected by the proud and conservative woman <>
the happily married isabel decides to take the ad out without telling her friend <>
when she makes contact with the right guy gald libolt and goes out with him three times to make sure that hes right for her friend she then surreptitiously invites him to her daughters wedding to meet the unsuspecting magali that is after she surprises gald and tells him that the ad was not for her but for her vintner friend <>
of course she feels good that she can still attract a man and also do this good deed for her friend <>
{} there is one more matchmaker in this film rosine alexia a sweet but manipulative college student who is going out with magalis son leo darmon on the rebound after having a recent affair with her much older philosophy professor etienne sandre <>
rosine loves leos mother but does not love her son to his disappointment and says she is only seeing leo so she can continue talking with magali <>
she has ended the affair with the professor insisting on them remaining friends so she can pick up any pearls of wisdom he might throw out as they converse <>
she seems to love his philosophy more than she loves him <>
he of course cant keep his hands off her <>
rosine feeling the emptiness in her friends life decides to bring the professor to emilias wedding and introduce him to magali figuring this way she can kill two birds with one stone find him a woman and then she can feel safe to be his friend and in that way she will always have magali also for a friend <>
she does this after she shows snapshots to each and tells them what she is doing <>
what distinguishes her matchmaking from isabelles is that she does everything the proper way telling all parties concerned even leo <>
but her matchmaking doesnt work because there is no chemistry them <>
{} what is most endearing about the film even if it is a bourgeois tale is that it has a french charm to it and a deepseated respect for all the people involved <>
that the amorous professor and the playful and impulsive rosine and the dull leo are shown in equal terms with the industrious magali and the elegant isabelle and the sincere salesman gald which is a sly way of telling the story in a nonjudgmental way <>
theres much to recommend in this film that feels right and touches a sore subject that should interest mostly those in their forties and later years of life what the story lacks is a great deal of imagination and a something more substantial in it to make the modest story have something more to say than it does <>
the film only goes so far in being realistic before it has to resort to farcical contrivances to keep our interests <>
but even if it is not always interesting it does keep us on our toes rooting for the nice winemaker to come up with something more than a bumper crop <>
{} this was rohmers fourth and final film about the seasonal cycle and it might be the best one letting in the most sunlight and being very pleasurable to watch highlighted by fine acting by all concerned <>
by the time the film ends we have the feeling that we really know these individuals it is as if we met them in real life and they have become our acquaintances <>

{} when i look at the deep south the first thing that comes to my mind is their history of racial problems <>
in the sleepy town of hollis springs mississippi much of the town is registered as a landmark in historical memories as altman gently moves his camera across the various personalities who live there it is as if each one is an archetype specially depicted for this comicdrama story and the town stands out in the background as a reminder of the past <>
{} firstly we look in on the local police the dreaded bigots from the days of segregation as we see them appear as forbearing as they always do as they leave their stationhouse before going on patrol but we will see later on that this is an integrated force now and a more amiable one then the camera takes us to a black bar where we hear the rich sounds of the blues being belted out in the wee morning hours by a sultry josie ruby and then we switch over to the white folks putting on a rehearsal for an oscar wilde easter play about john the baptist at the presbyterian church with the drama being directed by the intractably arrogant camille close with her not too talented younger sister cora moore being unduly manipulated by her as she is being coached for her lead role of salome <>
these two scenes contrast how the blacks and whites of hollis springs spend their evenings <>
{} next we follow willis dutton who is the soul of this film standing for trust and reconciliation with the past as he drunkingly walks out of the black bar and heads across town passing a van with the sleeping emma liv inside who just returned from leaving town over something that frustrated her but is back now working for manny lyle gutting catfish his love for her being a one way street as he acts like a peeping tom hovering around her van <>
finally we see willis break into the house of an old rich white lady cookie <>
played with charm and crackling wit by veteran actress patricia neal who rarely makes a film appearance anymore <>
but it turns out these two are the best of friends and he only came by to clean her guns at one in the morning since he promised her he would do it that evening as he looks after her ever since her husband buck died a few years ago and he also wants to tell her that her daughter emma is back in town <>
we will later on learn as it is one of the towns wellkept secrets that she is actually the yearold daughter of cora <>
{} what altman has done is paint a picture of the town full of local flavor trying to test us to see if we guessed right at what our first impressions of the locals was as those of us who have not kept up with the changes in the south or have not been brought up there might view things from an outdated way of seeing the new south thinking the worst of them but now surprised to find that the only thing that has not changed about our perceptions of the south is how dull witted some of them can still be <>
{} altmans other aims are to uncover all the towns little nasty secrets that is so easily hidden by its southern hospitality and history of racism <>
though the tone of altmans film is always light and never very haunting <>
this is one of his mild films he doesnt penetrate deeper than the story itself takes us <>
even if it is tightly directed with no visible flaws in the storyline and the films purpose everything about it turns out to be as pleasing as the smell of magnolias in the spring <>
and thereby we are cheated into seeing something that could have been most revealing instead we are offered something that is really too bland and simplistic for its own good <>
even if it is a satisfying film it is still most easily categorized into the feel good type of mold something altman might have winced at in his heyday of filmmaking in the s <>
{} the climactic scene revolves around cookies desire to join her husband in the afterworld since life has no meaning for her without him as she is only living for her memories of him therefore she shoots herself leaving a suicide note for willis but unfortunately her diabolical aunt camille who comes over for a fruit bowl finds her body and eats the suicide note while stealing worthless trinkets from the house and then telling cora that this wasnt a suicide only insane people kill themselves and no one in our family is insane as she takes the gun out of cookies hand and throws it into a flower bed and has cora call the police while reminding her to tell them it was a robbery and murder supposedly covering up the suicide to protect their cherished family name <>
{} unfortunately the goodhearted willis becomes a suspect because his fingerprints are all over the house and on all the guns <>
what is comical or tragic depending on what kind of a sense of humor you have is watching how the crime scene is being trampled on and the murder investigation done in such an amateurish way that the investigators of the little jon benet ramsey murder in boulder colorado would look like scotland yard investigators in comparison to this sheriffs department <>
{} there is a love story played out by emma and jason chris who is the junior member of the police department <>
their romance is a series of lustful encounters that is mostly comical as it adds to the story by giving it a more local flavoring <>
{} as far as the police go they dont think willis did it but they hold him in an unlocked cell and play scrabble with him while he puts all his trust in them to uncover the truth <>
now this is as far a cry from the old mississippi as one can imagine though there are still some lingering subtle racial prejudices around <>
but the best argument given for why willis couldnt have done the crime is given by the sheriff lester ned who says because i went fishing with him <>
which i guess could best be understood as a very logical statement by those who were brought up in a smalltown <>
{} the film ends on coras spiteful comment to her sister as she sticks to the story her controlling sister gave her that it wasnt a suicide as she triumphantly exclaims i did good didnt i <>
{} the films decency shines through all the past racial injustices and maybe things are getting better in the south at least that is the message we are left with and i see no reason to be of a different opinion <>
but that last framed shot of the sheriff and emma and the lawyer and willis sitting on the dock fishing was a little too rosy a picture for me to take in all at once <>
{} cookies fortune turns out to be in the unlocking of the past by the revelation about heritage and parenthood for the family members of cookie orcutt <>
trying to come to terms with the past is something the south as well as the rest of the country is still hopefully working on <>
race relations might be the biggest problem americans are still faced with and finding a cordial way out of it is the aim of a lot of good folks <>
the weakness of this film is that its overall decency is not moving enough of an experience to make this anything but a mildly entertaining film that captured a little something about the souths past and future and made us feel a little better that we saw it but did not set off any bigger sparks or really create any excitement about the town or its inhabitants that is worth taking note of <>

{} if you like nonsense musicals with plenty of singing beautiful set designs fantastic colors sex witchcraft and a fairy tale charm to it then you will probably like this film which is in many ways like flying down to rio <>

but if you are in a mood for some light entertainment this zany musical has plenty of oomph and should satisfy your latino appetite for something that is easy and sexy to look at <>
{} the little known director of this film hails from venezuela which gives this french film a very natural latin twist to its story and music <>
the film opens in a venezuelan church where ana ariadna is about to get married at the altar but for some inexplicable reason changes her mind and runs out of the church grabs a taxi packs her maria callas poster and is on a plane for paris still in her wedding dress <>

{} another feel good type foreign movie ala the full monty that seems to please the audience drawing in enough crowds to turn a nifty profit for its independent producers and is good enough so that the critics are very generous in their praises playing down the films bland politics <>
{} a quaint irish village replete with ordinary type of folks as eccentrics a clever little plot with a few surprises thrown in for down the road a bunch of likable locals colorful scenery wonderful irish pipes heard in the background and it all adds up to a gentle and charming little film with no deep messages or symbolism attached to it <>
though the name devine is pretty close to divine the subject of religion is dealt with in a lighter manner as the visiting priest dermot tells the young boy hickey that he works for jesus and the kid retorts that he wouldnt work for anyone who doesnt pay him or for someone he never met <>
{} the only serious flaw in the film is a contrived phone booth scene towards the end of the movie <>
that scene absolves the film from dealing with any bigger moral questions it might have raised by getting rid of the fly in the ointment the one character in the village that upset its tranquility <>
the strength in the film lies in the great acting job accomplished by the townfolks especially ian bannen jackie oshea david kelly michael osullivan and fionnula flanagan annie oshea <>
they gave the film a rich quality that goes beyond the story line and the moral implications of the scam that they perpetrated <>
{} someone in this small village of people tullymore is reported as the winner of the irish lottery worth close to million pounds <>
but when no one claims it jackie becomes suspicious of who that could be <>
he discovers it is the elderly loner ned devine who has dropped dead from shock still clutching the ticket in his hand when jackie visits his house <>
so he recruits the help of his dear friend michael to act as the dead ned devine so that they can fool the lottery people and collect the winnings <>
michael is a genuine character who steals the picture with a classic comical motorcycle ride in the nude as he races down some backroads to beat the lottery man brendan to ned devines house <>
but they soon realize that they will have to tell the rest of the town their plan in order for this to work <>
they get everyone in town in line but for one nasty old woman dromey who is deemed the towns witch to agree that they will split the money equally and they will swear to the lottery people that michael is ned <>
{} life in the village goes on in its routine way and we get to see some of the jealousies that exist in town the class differences and how quiet and set in its ways the townfolks really are <>

maggie lynch has a young boy and no husband <>
she has a few suitors but has not told them who is the childs father <>

{} well the kids father turns out to be none other than ned devine <>
by right maggie could have claimed all of the lottery winnings but decides it is better that the kid have someone he can call a father who will raise him than all the money from the lottery ticket <>

{} this is played out against the negativity of the current nixon administration with some of the teens reflecting their parents conservative political views and others vehemently on opposite sides of their parents this is also a film about the parents dissatisfaction with their empty lives as they grumble about what they perceive to be missing in their lives <>
this dissatisfaction makes it possible for an affair between ben and jane to take place <>
but even that affair is stale after he cant stop talking in bed and she chillingly tells him to keep quiet you are boring me i have a husband and i dont need another one <>
{} the lives of the children are scrutinized in the same way their parents lives are and the results are almost identical <>

{} the introduction of nature into their lives brings about a stark reality in the form of the thanksgiving ice storm <>
the ice storm is magnificently opulent in its whitish blueish and gray colors the ice was artificially made but it looks only too real <>
it symbolically represents the truth that cant be denied no matter what games the adults wifeswapping and children touching their private parts play <>
the beauty of the ice storm is even more menacing and attractive when it is added to the more placid beauty of the towns countryside but it is also dangerous as we see how the one surbanite truly influenced by the beauty of the storm also succumbs to it <>
{} it is amazing that this film was made by a foreigner who is able to get into some of the nuances that pricked the skin of those living through those times it still surprises me though hollywood has a rich history of foreigners doing just that examples would be messieurs lang and sirk <>

{} these are successful people and there is a reason why they are successful and for all the holes in their life we see how they are able to go after what they want and get it the only thing that seems to be alluding them and out of their reach is gaining peace of mind <>

its use of the ice storms raw power in all its beauty and danger as a metaphor on the dysfunctionality of the characters were both wellutilized and at the same time utilized too much <>
the ice storm came to symbolize what can so easily be taken away from any one in one rapid moment if one is not prudent or careful in their life <>
the film can be slightly faulted for putting too much weight on the ice storm and its symbolical message and for trying to make too much of the comparison between the children and the parents thereby not doing enough justice to either as the characterizations tended to appear to be too forced into fitting in with the metaphor of the ice storm <>

{} this intelligent and emotionally moving film is based on the truelife story as recorded in the autobiography a genius in the family written by one of the musical prodigy english sisters hilary rachel the flautist in the du pre family <>
jackie emily is the younger sister the one who reaches fame as a virtuoso cellist especially known for her interpretations of elgars compositions <>
the crux of the film is about their sisterly relationship their competition with each other and their need for each other as they were growing up in the s <>
the differences between them that eventually has them living disparate lives becomes the dramatic focal point of the film with jackie growing up to become the great musician who marries another celebrated musician daniel barenboim james but who is very unhappy for reasons that are very complex and not easily answered but thoroughly explored in the film leaving the audience to be the judge of what might have gone wrong while hilary finds bliss in domesticity giving up music to live in the country and raise chickens and children with her vibrant husband kiffer david <>
{} the cast is superb <>
emily watson in the very difficult and trying role of a petulant genius searching for answers about herself plagued by selfdoubt that borders on madness and the need for close ties to home is brilliantly portrayed as she reveals jackies compelling character showing her supple musical knowhow and her erotic sexual liberation and her binding commitment to what she wants to pursue and towards the end of her life a spunky grit to deal with her debilitating illness of multiple sclerosis that will take her life in when she is just yearsold in a most unmerciful way <>
{} it is rare that a film has such a meaty part for one woman to play <>
this film has two such parts <>
the other female lead is admirably played by rachel as she is solid in her role as the first prodigy child to shine brightly and as the jealous one when she realizes her sister has caught up with her talent wise and will soon surpass her <>
we can read her mind as she grapples with her inability to grow as a musician and when kiffer aggressively pursues her and weds her giving her the selfesteem she has always wanted she will cease to be a professional musician <>
{} the girls never seemed taken with a genuine love of music except as it suited their talents <>
their strivings for success was at first a reason to be coddled by their ambitious stage mother celia then it became a chance for the sisters to remain close each sharing the spotlight and then something mysterious happened perhaps a twist of fate that allowed hilary to fall off the pedestal while the once weaker performer jackie took her practice to heart just to keep up with her older sister who now becomes recognized by the world for her musical talent <>
the stage father dance has a rather interesting role as the moralist in the family who is a bit of a stodgy kind of antisemite mom too whose bemused character might be summed up as he is reflecting on his daughters marriage to barenboim and conversion to the jewish religion she cant be jewish she is blond <>
{} the film begins innocently on a deserted english beach where the sisters played by keely flanders and auriol evans happily frolic on the sand meeting a strange ghostlike woman who tells jackie in a whisper everything will be all right <>
this ominous tone sets a haunting mood for the film that will quickly move away from these seemingly happy days of their youth and take them to their adulthood where distance will separate them in a way that they could never have believed possible from their early upbringing <>
{} the wellcrafted screenplay by frank cottrell boyce is ably directed by tucker who is directing his first feature film <>
the only fault i found with his direction is that i thought it was unnecessary to have duplicate scenes of what hilary and jackie experienced that is we didnt have to see it from each ones point of view <>
i thought the film would have been better served if the action was continuous the going back over the same scenes from a different point of view really killed the pace of the film slowing it down too much <>
the sisterly relationship was so powerful and subtle that when jackie runs away from barenboim for no apparent reason and winds up at hilarys remote country house and suggests to hilary that she allow her devoted husband to service her we are caught up in the intrigues of a very trying sibling rivalry that questions sensibility and ones mores all the while testing the sisters very genuine affection for each other <>
{} this is a film that glows with confidence sparked by a maturity of material that tries to unravel some of the mysteries in life that make one wonder about certain decisions made that can impact ones entire life <>
the film worked so well because of the contrasts between the two female stars they prevented the film from burying itself in a pit of sadness and also it was deftly handled by the directors ability to keep the movie light not to make jackies situation into a downer <>
and the music helped it was simply marvelous <>

{} this is a gritty workmanlike ww hbo made for tv movie that is much better surprisingly than most of those kind of movies usually are taking place in a battlefield in the hurtgen forest on the border of belgium and germany though it was shot in hungary <>
this battle was a precursor to the battle of the bulge and is not as well known but u s troops did lose their lives there in bloody combat <>
the film is seen through the eyes of pvt manning ron whose main purpose in battle is to stay alive <>
in a year when two epic war films were made saving private ryan and the thin red line this low budget movie holds its own with those films storywise only lacking the great cinematography of those films but its cinematography was realistic enough aiding in the clarity of telling the story that is highlighted by an engaging characterization by ron eldard and the other soldiers who look as if they are really ww soldiers <>
eldards quiet toughness and demeanor seems to fit his role as a nonconformist soldier even though manning is not exactly a hero but more of a man who is wrestling with his conscience thrust into a situation he didnt relish due to unforeseen circumstances and clever manuevering by his superior officers a role in which he comes through in the end with flying colors ironically getting killed in action in the end because of his reward for previously surviving <>
now this has been tried in many of the older ww films but for the most part it didnt work because the acting was not as convincing as these unheralded actors are <>
{} we first see manning in action trying to carry one of the badly wounded survivors from his squad back to his company area but is resisted by the soldier who is scared out of his mind <>
manning is forced to shoot him rather than leave him behind in pain with no chance of being rescued <>
upon his return to his company his commander captain pritchett donovan has the task of telling him he is the sole survivor and to his regret even if he doesnt fully trust manning he at least recognizes that he has an innate battle sense which is why he chooses to make him a sergeant it will be his job to lead the new replacements into the next battle which is part of the big push toward germany <>
the heart of the movie revolves around the credibility of the human drama involving how manning is forced to take this responsible position even as he tries to talk the captain out of it knowing full well that he will now have to look out not only for himself but for others when his ability to survive before just depended on how he looked out for himself which he proved that he was quite capable of doing <>
in such a short time we feel that we know manning and know what he will do and that his tough mental attitude seems more realistic than many of the other soldiers we see with a proper military attitude <>
it is hard to say for sure if we can like a person such as manning but even as we question his motives whether or not they are selfish we still respect him as a man who will not blindly follow orders even if he has to be insubordinate <>
this fuzziness about his character holds our interest throughout the film <>
{} the replacement soldiers have no clue of what they are getting into having no battle experience as they are now unfairly thrust into the middle of some of the fiercest fighting taking place <>
one of the new soldiers warren zak is perfecto for this part <>
when on his first tour in a foxhole he asks the person he relieves of duty the most sensible question he can ask what am i supposed to do here <>
the logic of that question and the inexperience of his new sergeant in telling him what to do on watch and the natural snafus that are part of the army all come into play in the consternation written all over warrens chubby bespectacled purely innocent american face stuck in a war whose ideology sounds good in the text books and newspapers back home but has a strange way of losing force in a foxhole <>
warren was undoubtedly picked on by manning for this detail because of his nerdy physical appearance and his inability to hide his greenness and fear <>
be that as it may warren grows up rapidly and handles himself with dignity and becomes the sole survivor as he becomes mannings heir apparent <>
{} there is some kind of friction between the field officers and the regular soldiers the ones who bear the brunt of the war and who are asked to die for their country if need be <>
dwight yoakam plays the lt colonel who is acting the part of the hardnosed uncaring leader sending men into battles where there is little chance of them returning in one piece <>
thusly he orders capt pritchett to take a bridge the germans have heavy firepower on <>
here the story gets a little incredulous as no squad volunteers for that detail the captain tells manning he will give him a section discharge if he volunteers for the job <>
manning had previously asked for that but it was denied him but here it sounds phony that manning would accept but he does putting his new replacements in a danger they really shouldnt have been in just for his selfish interest <>
everyone in the squad gets killed but manning and warren but the bridge is temporarily secured by the combat instincts of manning <>
a few things then happen as this tightly drawn tale begins to weaken into a predictable ending as lt lukas olyphant has a nervous break down after seeing all the casualties and the lt colonel orders manning to take his place and be a lieutenant again this is done against mannings wishes <>
also a sgt talbot bruno who resents mannings unwillingness to be a team player accuses him of abandoning his green troops and coming back again without a full squad <>
{} each of the recent war films i have seen has its own grit and dirt to it as they seemed to be made nowadays with a new determination to be more realistic and less all apple pie than ever before as most of the previetnam war films were <>
i welcome this kind of realistic filmmaking and since war never seems to go out of style it is worthwhile seeing how young men fight in such wars maybe some day all sides will figure out that there is a better way to settle things <>
until then there is nothing like a good war film to bring the war into our homes and consciousness and this one is a reasonably good one <>

{} it is difficult to know what to believe is right and wrong about this ken loach politicoromance film that is guaranteed to never completely satisfy one politically or romantically as it takes the ruling governments sandinistas side left wing over the cia supported contra right wing guerrillas side in the nicaraguan war in and it does this as seen through the romance between an emotionally unbalanced glasgow bus driver george carlyle who falls for a destitute and friendless nicaraguan refugee to his country carla oyanka cabezas <>
their romance is believable as long as the story remained in scotland <>
{} if loach stayed in scotland with the story as he does in the first half of this film and not transport it to nicaragua then we might have gotten somewhere with this unlikely romance between the politically unaware and insubordinate bus driver and his unpaying passenger whose romance starts out when an inspector gets on his bus and challenges her for a ticket as george comes to her aid and is given a weeks suspension for his rudeness to the inspector <>
by chasing after the hard to get to know carla he discovers that she has troubling secrets about her past that she refuses to talk about <>
these dark secrets are about her lover she left behind who was an activist in the sandinista movement <>
the problem is so serious that she has twice attempted suicide in glasgow <>
{} george takes a doubledecker bus for a joy ride outside of glasgow to show his girlfriend the natural beauty of the scottish lochs and mountain sides he loved as a boy <>
this action will result in his dismissal from being a bus driver <>
he then impulsively makes up his mind to take her back to her country so she can resolve what is troubling her <>
once in nicaragua he is troubled by all the killing going on around him <>
the film turns into an expose of how terrible the cia is for backing the vicious animals who make up the contras <>
bradley campbell has the flat role of being the shill for screenwriter paul lavertys liberal pronouncements about the war as bradley is a former cia operative in nicaragua who has now become a pacifist working for a human rights organization <>
this is all trite and for me unlikely stuff <>
the romance is put on hold till we find out what happened to carlas lover <>
therefore the animated george of the first half of the film is reduced to being a passive tourist everyone showing him a thing or two about their country and the film flounders caught between a soft romance and a soft political treatise accomplishing neither one very successfully <>
george does manage to see how closeknit and joyous the nicaraguans can be despite the poverty of their country as he goes dancing with the village people <>
and to georges credit he knows when enough is enough so he resolves things with carla hears her song as she resolves things with her tortured lover who she at last finds out from bradley is still alive <>
george does the sensible thing for a highly emotional person to do he splits from here and heads for glasgow supposedly a better person for having loved abandoningly and made a little bit more politically aware of how bad the contras are by his unexpected adventure <>
i expect that hell really have something to say in the pubs when he gets back home where he belongs <>
{} it really wasnt that bad of a film it was just too flat and preachy <>
but it was pleasant to watch oyanka cabezas she was quite innocently alluring giving her role an authentic tone to it as there were moments when the story seemed to be reaching for something important to say and that she would be the best spokesperson to present the cause <>
but in the end the film never managed to be all that convincing probably because it sold its product too hard <>
and that is unfortunate because i didnt learn anything new about the nicaraguan political situation that i didnt know before <>
everything seemed too pat more like a stanley kramer liberal political film than a former ken loach politically independent film such as his land and freedom <>

{} probably the best of the charlie chans starring the swedish born warner oland in the feature role <>
he played the charlie chan role a total of times three others played it before he took over the role in with this film being his th performance <>
after his death in sidney toler the second best to oland took over and was a more than competent replacement his best charlie chan feature arguably being charlie chan at treasure island <>
chan is based on a reallife chinese detective named chang apana living in honolulu hawaii but embellished by the writing efforts of earl derr biggers <>
chans technique in wrapping up a murder case was to gather all suspects in one room and have the murderer confess when all the evidence weighed against him or her <>
{} this film is distinguished by oscar levant creating an opera for it called carnival and william kernell doing the libretto <>
it also has a fine cast of character actors with boris karloff playing a former opera baritone named gravelle who supposedly died in an opera house fire years ago in chicago when he was locked in his dressing room <>
he now has amnesia and is in a loony bin in los angeles <>
{} the film features the confucianlike sayings of wisdom from charlie and the acidly made retorts from the cops and suspects in a battle of who can come up with the deadliest oneliner <>
charlie is played with a subtle grace and aplomb by oland giving the film its lifeforce <>
{} the film opens as gravelle is playing the piano when he is interrupted by the mental institution guard who brings him the los angeles newspaper <>
gravelle becomes upset when he sees a picture of his former wife lilli rochelle margaret irving in the newspaper announcing that she will appear in the opening of the opera carnival and he angrily stomps his heel down on her picture indicating his memory has suddenly come back to him and he overpowers the guard telling him he must escape <>
{} after unsuccessfully setting up a dragnet for the escaped lunatic the police inspector regan guy usher calls in his old friend charlie chan to help as the cynical veteran of the force sergeant kelly william demarest makes some wisecracks about why do we need this egg foo young private eye to help us <>
soon lilli appears in the police station with the lead baritone singer of the opera enrico borelli gregory gaye and asks for police protection after telling them she received flowers backstage with a note that said you will die tonite <>
lilli is seen being followed from the police station by a private detective who works for her husband mr whitely frank conroy who suspects her of having an affair with borelli <>
{} to help charlie out his number one son lee chan keye luke he played kato in the green hornet disguises himself as a cast member extra and snoops around the opera house passing fingerprint clues to his father and creating some daffy comedy with the flustered sergeant kelly who is trying to track down the vengeful lunatic spotted in the theater by one of the wardrobe workers <>
{} the plot thickens when a young couple kitty charlotte henry and childers thomas beck insist on visiting lilli but are denied access to her by the evervigilant and wrongheaded sgt kelly <>
gravelle also visits the dressing room of lucretia borelli nedda harrigan telling her to keep quiet he will replace her baritone husband and sing the lead role in tonights opera opening <>
being angry with her philandering husband and dismayed with lilli she agrees to keep quiet as gravelle knocks borelli out and goes onstage replacing him <>
this is too much for lilli who recognizes her former husband after being certain he was dead and passes out <>
she is being cared for by her husband who only leaves her for a minute but when he returns she is knifed to death as was borelli <>
{} but charlie chan uses the power of deduction and good old police work to narrow down the list of suspects to either the lunatic gravely the jealous mr whitely or the embittered soprano mrs borelli <>
he eliminates the young couple as suspects when he finds out that shes the daughter of gravely and lilli and only came to see her mother to get permission to marry because shes underage <>
her mother refuses to acknowledge the child figuring it might ruin her career <>
{} the film had a convincing atmosphere and style about it and it had the peerless boris doing his chilling loony thing with great relish <>
to enjoy it one must overlook quite a few gaps in the story such as boris sudden recovery from amnesia it was never made clear why someone would want to kill him in a fire and why the police would put out a dragnet for an escaped mental patient who showed no signs of ever being violent <>
but lets forget the story this film is fun in an oldfashioned way and its many pearls of wisdom that come forth such as charlie explaining how a madman and a genius are sometimes similar because they both live in a world created by their ego <>
now how can you beat that for hollywoods orientalstyle of profundity <>

{} im italian dont you understand so go the utterings to deaf albanian police ears of gino enrico a brash young con man from italy who came to albania to be an assistant to another con man the more experienced fiore placido and has now gotten himself mired in the hopelessness of this country clinging to his superior italian birthright in the face of failing to pull off his scam and is left abandoned in albania <>
they came to this impoverished country to run a scam shoe company to make someone who is inept and has no relatives be the dummy chairman carmelo of their bogus company with their hope to get the italian government to give them a grant which they almost always do for those who fought the communist regime <>
the con men would then take the grant money and skip town never even making one pair of shoes <>
{} amelios film is a political one with a black comedic edge to it as it traces the tragic recent history of albania studying the dehumanizing effect bad governments have on its people <>
in its opening credits it uses actual newsreel footage of il duces arrival in albania as it shows his conquest of the country <>
when ww ended the soviet communist regime supported the local dictatorship and the country remained isolated with its vast problems of poverty unknown to most of the world that is until when a supposedly new democratic regime took over and opened up the country for the world to see <>
italy was flooded with a wave of albanian immigrants looking to that country to fulfill its utopian dreams because of its material and cultural strength but italy could not handle the onslaught of so many people and would not let anymore immigrants in <>
what remains for these people is a pipe dream of escaping to italy as they are stuck where they are <>
the new regime is just as bad as all the other regimes it is actually made up of most of the leaders from the past who only change the name of their ruling party <>
{} this is a rather slowmoving film that is chocked full of themes and universal messages the director feels impelled to get across <>
whether it is worthwhile or not to have a film be so politically motivated that it fails to be entertaining is up to you to decide <>
the political aims seem necessary to see and understand for the viewer the reward comes in images that stick with you long after viewing the film <>
therefore this becomes a special film not necessarily a better film but one that is made beneficial for those who are interested enough to stick with this films slow pace and all the political explorations that are needed to show how corrupt and decaying albania really is and how cherished the human spirit is sometimes able to survive on the barest evidence of hope <>
{} amelio open doors stolen children has so much political ground to cover that the film becomes overwhelmed with the misery of its exploration and suffers because of it <>
problems such as immigration poverty corruption cultural decadence ignorance hate greed and a generation influenced by italian television are just too complicated and heavy to handle without sacrificing something in the process <>
what is sacrificed is that though i liked what i saw i did not feel passionately about it <>
it was a cold but intellectually sound effort <>
{} the character of gino is examined most closely and he becomes the messenger for the directors viewpoint as he is trapped in the bleak albanian countryside trying to make his scam work <>
his car tires are stolen along with his passport identity clothes appearance and the arrogance he had when he first came <>
his handpicked chairman turns out to be an italian army deserter from and not an albanian anticommunist <>
the chairman has tried to stop time thinking he is still yearsold living as if nothing took place the last years since he has been in prison <>
he forms a very strange relationship with the italian both skeptical of him and later on thinking of him as a fellow traveler who is abused by the world situation <>
the heart of the film lies in the change that overcomes gino <>
this nightmarish episode in his life is certainly profound and deadly <>
he can never be the same again <>
by the final scene he is stripped of his worldly possessions ragged and tired looking looking somewhat like an albanian refuge <>
and that is the success of this film <>
we are forced into seeing the poverty that exists there and even if we dont like to be put in that position there is nothing that we can do about it <>
there are just no answers and the film is left without a happy ending only a few images of hope <>
this is seen when a little girl in a remote albanian village freely dances and dreams of a better life somewhere else than in the barren land she was born in <>

{} jazz saxophonist izzy maurer harvey keitel is hit by a stray bullet while performing at a nyc nightclub and suffers from a collapsed lung which will prevent him from playing the sax again <>
it also puts him in a depressed mood as he says he would rather die than live and not play his music <>
the remainder of the film flounders in long stretches of unbelievable fantasy some soothing touches of originality here and there oodles of romantic schmaltz and a story that cant hold up to intelligent scrutiny <>
but then again if you bought into the films gimmicky filmmaking style and didnt think it was a smartyarty pretentious ploy like i did then maybe you can have a better feel for how the story transpired than i did <>
{} izzys exwife hannah gina makes contact with him and even though she is happy living with her new boyfriend the producer philip kleinman mandy and his young daughter she tells him that she is concerned about him and reassures him that once i gave you my heart its forever even if i dont want to live with you anymore <>
this results in an invite to dinner at her place with phil and phils guest who will direct his next film the former actress and now director of a new production of pandoras box a contemporary remake of the film where louise brooks played the sexually liberated lulu in g w pabsts silent masterpiece <>
this time catherine moore vanessa is to be its director and is looking for a new face to play lulu <>
catherine gets a chance at the dinner table to tell izzy that she gave up acting because i didnt want to be invented by anyone anymore <>
but the funniest conversation at the dinner table is reserved for one between izzy and phil as phil wants izzys opinion on what he would do if he found a piece of turd on an airplane toilet seat cover after an attractive lady left the toilet like he did on a recent flight <>
{} while the sixtyishlooking izzy is recovering from his wounds a young waitress celia burns mira sorvino who is an aspiring actress reports to work at the fancy restaurant she works at and tells her boss pierre argo that she just bought the cd of the sax player who wont ever play again and plans to listen to him play for the firsttime when she gets off work <>
{} izzy walking home from his exs lower manhattan apartment after his dinner engagement stumbles upon a dead body of a man identified as stanley mars and finds in his briefcase a napkin with a telephone number and a stone which magically glows with a healing blue light when he darkens the room <>
the next day he calls the number on the napkin and its celia burns number and by coincidence she is listening to his cd <>
{} the stone causes the two strangers and unlikely lovers to feel connected to each other and thus starts a romance that is so syrupy that before you know it this love is so real to them that they are not only sleeping together right away but izzy becomes a busboy in her restaurant because he cant stay away from her even for a short time their romance is that sticky <>
and like the man says his job is to be with her now all the time <>
{} another coincidence is that lulu is trying out for the part of lulu in an audition <>
naturally izzy tells her that hell speak to phil and smooth things over <>
{} at the restaurant a patron gets fresh with the waitress and the hottempered izzy rushes needlessly to her aid <>
he gets fired and she quits as a matter of principle but is traumatized because she needs the money from the job her acting is not coming along as well as she hoped it would <>
{} but things change for the better when catherine calls her and tells her that she got the part as lulu and they will be soon filming in dublin <>
izzy tells her hell join her there in a few days but he never says why for the delay <>
but the reason becomes obvious when some thugs come questioning him about the stone and dislodge his apartment looking for it <>
you see it was a contrivance for the script <>
the filmmaker must have thought it would work out better for the story if he gets jumped in nyc rather than in dublin <>
{} after the thugs are through with him we find him held captive by a mysterious anthropologist dr van horn dafoe who questions him repeatedly about his childhood in the empty warehouse they keep him locked up in <>
it was kind of campy fun to follow his line of questioning it brought renewed vigor into the mystery part of the story as an attempt was made to clean up all the syrup that was spilled from the preceeding scenes and get back on the trail of the meaning of the stone <>
{} all we get to know about the mystery of the stone is from dr van horn as we hear him prattle on about how precious the stone is and if in the right hands such as his how much good it can do <>
there will be no payoff regarding knowing about this mystery which is a major problem with the film <>
{} there is so much wrong with this film that even when things are going well for it and it seems like theres some suspense and an intriguing bit of artiness thrown into the script inevitably it is ruined by a story that just doesnt make sense and even if it did make sense to those who are more tolerant of the film than i was it still doesnt excuse the filmmaker from trying to be too clever and disguising his story as something it isnt <>
to be more precise in my critique would be to give away the films flimsy payoff which would not be fair to those who havent seen lulu yet <>
{} i just got the feeling auster didnt know too much more about this mystery than the viewer did and because of that the film is lacking substance <>
i also thought keitel was too old to play the love interest of a much younger sorvino as their romance the keystone of the film failed to be inspiring as it should have been for the film to have had any chance to be effective <>
